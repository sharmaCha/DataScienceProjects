1,ill preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting atablet to perform at anywhere near that leveli have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured id give the kindle fire hda tryi chose the basegb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary ereader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet accesswhat ive found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviewsin fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the years best purchasefirst off the look is nice its sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than id imagined its not heavy enough to be considered a negativethe display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate responseto the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasantly surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to intuitfor those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide youi first checked out the ereader functionmy books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the readeri am a big fan of the kindle app for the ipad and am far more accustomed to its functionality but the fire performedvery well and my only complaint is that when searching the definition of a word wikipedia is used versus google on the kindle for ipadphone apps which is a step down in quality imo but certainly a small complaint overall and in the quickorwords i searched the answer was attainable from that page and did not require going over to the wikipedia page as some have reportednext i checked out silk the web browserthis aspect of the fire probably received the most complaints as the early reviews came init was reported to lag and to crash frequently even on amazons own sitei expected this to be the case as i tested it but i found that these problems must already have been addressed your tablet loads the newest version of the software upon your registration in subsequent updates as my experience was the ability to browse quickly and flawlessly across a number of varying websitesthis was the second surprise for me as i expected a far lower quality and especially a slower speed i couldnt be happier with what ive experienced so fari browsed the app store and found it very functional and easy to maneuver i set up my gmail within a matter of seconds and i looked through a variety of sales and offers at no time have i found slow speeds poor touch responses or any laggingthe kindle fire hd has exceeded my expectations in every way and i still cant believe i got it fortaxthis thing is an incredible bargain and so far its quality of performance holds its own against my ipad something i absolutely did not expect at this priceim sure as i become more familiar with the fire the reasons for the price difference between it and the ipad will become more apparent but when you consider the main reasons for which i purchased the fire it holds up marvelously wellagain this may be the years best purchase from a value standpointso fari wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyoneenjoyupdatesince writing this review back in october ive purchasedmore for my kidsin perhaps the greatest test of speed and function namely being easy fast and fun enough to be preferred by children these tablets have continued to impress and have proved that they are indeed a game changer in the world of budget tablets withmonths of rather heavy use under my belt i have experienced absolutely no technical difficulties and i remain a very satisfied customer i therefore continue to highly recommend this excellent tablet,positive
2,if you read my fire tv review you know that i am tough on amazon when it comes to their own items it needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions i will do my best to respond to them as i can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things i discover along the wayfirst my background i own many amazon kindles bw fire gen fire gen as well as apple ipad gensamsung noteand have an lg g smartphone had a samsung s before that notebooks chromebooks etc i have also used many other products including the fire hdx line i have a solid computer background as well but honestly i am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this oneamazon has changed many things over the life of the fire product line adding and removing features like camerasthe first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are backthey are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to younow to this model this is like a big smartphonewhich is a big difference from past kindles it is more compact lighter and yet still very usable in fact for me the shrinking of size increases the usefulness i find that i use my smartphone way more than my tabletseven the smaller fire hd and samsung note tablets so i am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones that means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops i am guilty of boththe screen is very goodcertainly not the top of the line but nice even if you factor paying twice the retail for it it is bright sharp with the same resolution as pastcomparing past kindle firesst generationinch xpixel resolution atppind generationinch xpixel resolution atppird generationinch xresolution atppi the first step up in resolutionth generationinch xppi this is the twin to this model and was just releasedwhereas thisinch model hasxppi that makes this display higher or the same resolution than any of the past kindle fires with the exception of the more expensive hdx it makes it sharper with more detail per inch than any of the past kindle fires of this smaller size again except for the hdx yet this is the cheapest fire yet which is quite impressivenow while amazon may love my giving thisinch fire astar rating they wouldnt like this next sentence there is absolutely no reason to even consider the newly releasedinch firemore gets you a less sharpdetailed screen more weight more bulk look at the extra space on the sides next to the screen of the newinch and the newinch and the only improvements is a second speaker and a larger screenin my opinion you should consider thisinch fire or consider spending twice as much to step up to the fire hdx with many improvements mayday button higher resolution faster processor dualband dual antenna mimo wifi and longer battery life the hdx has some issues with a blue halo around the screen so read reviews of that before jumpingso now that i have talked you out of the fireand covered some of the reasons for considering the firehdx lets talk more about the fire performanceappsit is quick but i am never happy enough lol responsive and like apple productsit just works now one plus and minus with all kindlesfires are that you can not use any app from googles app store that means you have to wait for apps to be brought into amazons app store which seems to be slow at getting new releases and new updates this is really an issue for amazon and one that still needs to be fixed the plus to this is that amazon keeps some of the junky apps out of the system and once they make it to amazons app store they are proven safe and generally work better than the fresh apps because bugs have been worked outamazons own apps are very well integrated into this and past fires they keep improving them and adding features without adding cost if you have prime you get streaming tv and movies free ebooks and now prime music if you have prime the added free content you get on the fire makes it a real standout against everything elsei use my firefor reading emails surfing the internet watching videos some of the time and playing some gamesapps like imdb i have found that it meets or exceeds what i have come to expect from these things in terms of performance and reliability are there bugs or glitches yes but less than my lg smartphone has and less than my samsung tab hassizeabout the size of the new large phones is very nicenot too big but not too small it is more portable feeling than theinch tablets and it is easy to hold it is fun to be part of the cool club without droppingtimes as much or signing ayear contractqualityamazon has proven overtime that they can make quality products and this is no exception at under a hundred dollars there is pretty much nothing else that is this feature packed with this finish quality i have experienced no quality issues and do not expect anything given amazons solid historybattery lifeso far so good i was able to stream video and surf the internet for well overhours without any hiccups from a device this compact with such a large screen that seems quite impressivesounddecent but apple products are cleaner sounding to me volume is usable in most situations but not necessarily in noisy outside situationsi am sure i have forgotten something so please feel free to ask questions this is my own opinion and while i dont know everythingi do my best to deliver honest reviews since reviews help me so much when i shopif you are in the market for a little tablet and have prime you have to decide between this fireor theinch hdx for twice the cost thisinch adds the rear camera and most of the performance while being smaller lighter at half the price,positive
3,for the low price this tablet really does more than expectedthe camera isnt great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesnt effect mehere are some of the pros and conspros low cost yet high techgreat screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as issmooth and responsiveeasy access to amazon prime contenteasy to wirelessly share content to a tvbattery lifeweb browser works greatcons doesnt have some apps android users are used to havingcamera quality isnt great and no flashless extra features than some higher priced tablets havei opted to go with the gb version with no adsthe ads arent a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screenno matter what version you pick they all do the same thingsthe gigs may or may not matter to youandgigs both arent very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows moviesmusic before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gigif you will always have internet connection then it isnt much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internetoverall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the hdx serieshowever if you want an amazing tablet but dont want to spend as much then these new hdseries are greatfor me and my uses the hdis the perfect fiti would suggest theover thefor most buyersthe onlythings thehas over theare a larger screen and dual speakerssure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than theat ppi thekeeps the same resolution as its last rd generationthehowever has ppi which make its screen a bit more crisphere are some of my thoughtssize the size is goodi prefer that it is a smaller size for ease of carryingas long as you see well up close thisis a great sizebattery life very sufficient for my needsthe kindle hdxs have a little longer battery life however thishour specd battery life has been lasting a long time and never getting too low for my usessound sound isnt badit is comparable to a laptop from a few years backthehas only a mono speaker but it is loud enough and crispi find it is plenty for watching a tv show or moviefor music i prefer a speaker or headphonesbut that goes for pretty much any tabletcheck out my youtube earthling for some more information on this tablet,positive

5,im starting off my saying im not just antikindleive owned an original kindle and a nd gen kindle fire hd i loved them bothmy husband owns one he loves it my kids played mine all the time so much they loved themso for christmas we decided to get my older two children their own kindle fires we selected this model due to a tremendous price discount on cyber mondaywe opened them up at christmas and now my daughter is constantly frustrated she continues to get a message warning her that storage space is getting low and it shuts the wireless connection down so she cant watch the streaming video that is part of kindle freetime or even download the little games in freetimeso being the tech family we are im an it tech my husband is a computer engineer so we arent stupid when it comes to tech devices we began looking into thisi know that this is the gb model i see that it is advertised as above as havingof that gb available for the useri call bs on thatsee attached photoof the entiregb available according to the above advertising you get considerably lesswhy is amazon telling me that i get that much space available when their system applications stuff i cant uninstall either take up some of that space and then system files take ofof a gig on this one andof a gig on my sons kindlewhen i click on system to see what it includes it says this catergory includes system cache logs texttospeech files and other system files i cant see what it isthese people knew how much of their random system files and settings would eat into my storage spaceso dont give me a little sales pitch that i getwhen i dontso i did some diggingmy husbandsgb kindle fire hd nd gen lets us know thatgb are availablewhich means the android os the kindle fire os thats on top of the android system and all the system files and behind the scenes stuff are planned to take upgbwhich would be about rightsystem files user accounts system settings etc use up aboutgb of the advertisedgb of user storageso amazon should be honest and sayyou get gb of storage not im highly disappointed in this its frustrating and disappointingmy personal recommendation to friends and family will definitely not include this type of kindle again,negative
6,i was very surprised to find that i absolutely love this little devicesurprised because i had the very first fire and the very first fire hd and ended up giving them to family members because i just didnt like themi was hesitant to try theinch since i didnt like theinch and was pleasantly surprised to find that i really really liked itit was easy to set upemail and my amazon purchases loaded very quicklyi have the kindle pw but usually do all of my reading on the ipad mini kindle app due to the fact that i like the larger screen over the pwi only use the pw when i am reading at night in bed if i cant sleepthat is why i am surprised that reading on the fire hdis just so nice and appealingi like the feel and build of the fireit is heavier in the hand than the pw but the heaviness adds to the feeling of qualityit has a nice solid feel and is very comfortable to hold one handedthe screen for viewing videos is absolutely beautiful i think better than the ipad minii bought this mainly to have the text to speech function and it worked very well with the book i was currently readingthe speaker is not that bad but i almost always use headphones so the mono speaker is no big deal for megb is not a lot since you really get less than that for your own content but i currently have two episodes of soa on it an audio book one game and five books and i still have just under gb left to usethe battery life is pretty goodmuch better than the previous fire hd i had triedi use the ipod touch at work mainly to stream the instant videos and my music never liked reading on it but with the larger screen on the fire hd my ipod is going to be sitting at home while the mini fire is going to be my constant companionnow on to my complaintswhich are very fewi wish the back of the fire hd was a little more skid resistant and i really wish the lighting could be turned down to almost blackfor me at the lowest setting it is still way too bright to use comfortably in a dark roomi know there is an app out there to help with this but the device should be able to accommodate almost zero light itselfalso i really wish that amazon would adopt the swipe up and down the screen to adjust your light settingkobo was able to do this to their aura hd with a firmware update and i really wish amazon would do this tooa truly immersive reading experience should mean being able to make all your adjustments while still reading without having to stop reading and go thru menus to reach the settings you need ambient light sensor is still having the device decide what is best and you still need to make adjustments to what you likeall in allgood job on this oneits small enough to go everywhere with you and heavy enough to feel well builtupdatei never thought i would ever say this because i always have loved my ipad minibut i am reading more on this little fire and my mini has been sitting in the drawer ever since i unboxed the fire,neutral
7,first let me say that i love amazon and feel it truly provides a great shopping place for momsi buy many items in which i am very happy with through its website and this is perhaps why i am so disappointed with this purchasei do not make snap decisions and take time to research an item before buyingi also rarely spendon any given itemi bought this tablet because of the marketing done on the product and what the commercials said this tablet was capable ofi saw the commercial where the tab slid off a car hood and survived hitting the concrete as well as the commercial where it took a tumble down the stairs and lastly the tumble it took in the tumbling mechanismmy tablet was not so fortunateit took a mereft fall and the screen shattered beyond the point of usethe commercials lead one to believe it should be able to survive this but mine did nothad i known it was going to be like all the other tablets out there i would have taken better precautions to ensure it didn’t have a chance to breaki feel that amazon has wrongly misled its customer’s in its marketing efforts to sale this producti have only had the tablet formonths and am no longer able to use iti called amazon to voice my concern and was not offered much other than a replacement that cost me almost as much as a brand new deviceso be cautious if buying this tablet it is just like all the others out therebuy a case to protect it and treat it as you do your other devices as it is not indispensable as the commercials claim,positive
8,its fine just like my last one that was stolen i need to formiliarize myself all over again,negative
9,ordered this for ouryear old to replace her first generation kindle fire during setup i found out that amazon has intentionally blocked all casting from the latestupdate to chromecast not even netflix will cast with this as it has with our oldkindle fire it will be on its way back to amazon shortly,negative
10,incredible little machineads on the main pages but they are not bothersomefunctions totally intuitive no learning curve at alli hated the kindle bought a nook and amazon has now done the hardest thing in retail they have earned back a customer they lostcombine the quality of this product with prime and their renewed commitment to actually serving the customer and they are unbeatablei have an ipad and this device completely replaced it inhoursdoes everything more reliably and more intuitivelyabout the only thing the ipad still wins at is linking with itunesso if you are an itunes music only person this might still be a difficult questionbut this fire does everything else better than my ipad email videotv web browse readerthe app war still hinges on android being twitchy cheaper wider and apple being more reliable narrow pricier but i rarely use apps except games which are fine either way if anything they are better organized and easier to get at on the fire if you are a gamereverything is easier to get at heremuch better devicemuch less expensiveway way better customer servicei rarely leave reviews but amazon has hit the retail ball out of the park with prime and firethey are winning againcongrats,neutral
11,i have had the tablet for a week i am a member of the apple evil ecosystem with iphone s ipad mini ipad air and macbook air while having another tablet is a bit absurd the fire hdis much more pocketable than the ipad mini and much less expensive to replace if lost therefore the niche i use it for is to carry it around while out and about much like my iphone with its most direct competitor being the iphoneplus but with a screen just big enough to read comfortablyi might use it as my alarm clock since the clock has an excellent night stand viewsince i am not a member of the googleandroid evil ecosystem inability to use those appsmusic is irrelevant to me if anything i would want the fire to be more like a cheaper smaller ipad i would like my apple newsmagazine subscriptions to be fully usable with fire apps my national geographic subscription works fine on the fire as does my nyt digital subscription but the fire nyt app is more limited than the apple one however there is enough common appsinteroperability eg outlook exchange onenote not to mind leaving the apple realm and entering the amazon dominionthe build quality of the tablet seems solid though thinnerlighter would be nicer and battery life and screen quality are excellent the accuracy and fluidity of the touch screen are comparable with an ipad the tablet seems quick but sometimes lags but so do my ipads i have not found the software to be buggy most steps and features are fairly consistent with other tablets and therefore are not hard to learn amazon should consider adding a may day option that users could purchase if they are new to tabletsthis tablet is best for something thats easy to pocket but big enough to read many could use it comfortably as a primary tablet but a higher end amazon tablet would better fill that role the size of the fire hdalso seems to eliminate many reasons for having a kindle device except for reading in the sun or next to a lightsensitive bed mate,neutral
12,i bought this for my sonyear old for christmas he loved it everything was great the sound the speed the clarity awesome it had all the games and books and music awesomebut he was outside today and it slipped from his hand and fell on the ground and the screen shattered he isso the fall could have been not more thanfeet he did not throw it down it slippedi called amazon to see if there was something that could be done it was onlymonths old nope i was told a dropping the device voided the warrantythere is no repair kit or vendor but she could offer me a discount ofa six dollar discount from the current price i bought it forso not really a discount for me while understand that electronic are fragile when you see the commercials where kindles are dropped down a fight of uncarpeted stairs or fall off a vehicle on to the pavement without a scratch lets just say dont believe the hype,neutral

14,was everything and more then what i expected,positive
15,for the price you cannot go wrong with this tablet it actually does more than i expectedit is similar to the ipad mini that i used to owni actually have owned and still own many apple products but wanted to use this tablet to watch my prime videos and listen to music with the prime musicthe app store is okay for the kindle though not as good as the android and apple stores but sufficethe camera is an awful mp that is very noisy photography term for pixelatedthe mono speaker is such old technology the touch screen is not as responsive as my iphonethough these may seem like many complaints once again this product is less thanother tablets for that price were just phony toys for kidsyou could actually use this at your work or at schoolyou will not find a tablet like this from another company for under if you want to buy theone then formore you can i do like the fact that i can fit this in my pocket but is big enough to type notes and watch moviesi would recommend this product to my friends and family and to others and i will buy another one soon in blue in a couple weeks,neutral
16,warning if you have a limited data plan this device should only be used if you have unlimited or lots of data as it constantly transfers large amounts of data without notification even if you never stream video or musicthe first day we fired this up it used over gb of data just updating and installing free junk we did not request or wantwe paid extra not to get the adsand i would imagine that they constantly update and use even more datai have owned everykindle since the originalone and loved them allbut this one greatly disappointed mewe are rural and data is expensive but this device seems to assume that everyone has unlimited datathere does not seem to be anyway to limit its data consumption so every time you enable wireless you will have no control over how much data it usesthe touch screen seems far worse than the original fire requiring several taps to select thingsmy wife downloaded an audible book and when she tried to open it the second time the screen did not respond so she tapped it twice which then deleted the book with no notice very poor design and not nearly as well done as the original fire that we each use for hours every dayi spent my engineering career designing computers and i regard this as a device that should not have been released until the bugs were worked outbefore you sell a product the software should be updated and not require a huge update right after power upwe bought this for the size and bluetooth streaming but may have to return it if there is no way to fix the data consumption,neutral
17,if you love kindles you will love thethree of us in my household have the earlier generation kindle fire hd which we won’t part with one also has a very early kindle which he reads in bed used to it it has a light won’t give it upi am not quite an early adopter but close and i worried about buyingof these sight unseen one for my sister and two as prizes for children in a low income neighborhoodyesterday i asked my husband to try out reading his current book on a newhe didn’t put it down even though it as yet has no case and he is used to reading kindles like a book—open and closemy joy was finding all my music there all my books and emails etc who cares about the camera my husband is a professional and loves his various nikons he won’t use anything elsei care for those quick shots to capture the deer nibbling at my shrubs the dog doing something adorable the children caught in fun “i thought you were reading”i am reading no fabulous shots but it’s in my kindlei haven’t given it the full workout but i will before we deregister them and give them to worthy schoolchildrenbut they are so light and so reasonable i am thinking of buying one for my handbag… commuting airplanes doctors and dentists offices with their interminable waits coffee shops…and keeping my earlier joy the original kindle hd at bedside and syncingbased on this two day experience i won’t buy stock in amazon they can’t make a profit on these delightful and inexpensive,positive
18,let me stress that for the feature i enjoy most you must paymore to get the gb version in order to fully utilize though works with gb this is the feature that allows you to download a huge library of amazon prime free videos including many top hbo and showtime series as well as amazons transformed as i am on a trainhours a day this offline viewing is worth many times to price of this device just make sure you have the gb version as the gb version ultimately has only about gb free storage making it essentially a cloud device also when downloading videos i suggest choose the better downloading format which is the middle choice between lower and higher resolution and storage i find this to be perfectly acceptable from a viwing standpointoverall the screen resoloution and sharpness is better than i expected i agree that this can also serve as a terrific ereader and if you do not have an ipad a fun device to play games on i find the touchscreen not to always be perfectly responsive but am guessing this can be fixed by a software updatefantastic value overall,positive
19,i bought them for my boys its a perfect size for them they keep them on the charger while at school and can play them until time for bed its not my first time getting a kindle fire but first for my boys the quality is great and they are having a blast using them,positive
20,i have a kindle firest generation and i love it i didnt need the hdg tablet but i wanted something smaller and i love this size the price is so fantasticfor a tablet is such a deali wasnt sure how i would like reading on a smaller device but i actually like it better even better than my kindle ereaderi was pleasantly surprised to find that this little tablet really is much faster than my larger one and it seems to use less battery power i got lots of free apps and loaded it up with books musicand photos this didnt slow it down music does take up more storage than anything elsei had no trouble downloading books audiobooks music and pictures the tablet is very easy to navigate despite the smaller size i dont even need a stylusthis is my fourth kindle product i bought the st and rd generation ereaders and thetablet and they just keep making them better i have never had any issues other than a couple charging issues when thefirst came out but it was fixed quicklythestreams very quickly no glitches and looks fantastic it is faster than my laptop and larger tablet its amazingi do wish there was a flash for the camera especially since it is both front and rear facing i would use it more this is the only con i have foundthis is another great amazon product that comes with all the extra features they offer their customersi used to think people were crazy for reading on their phones but this isnt much bigger than some and i could read on this all day it truly is a stealupdatei am still loving this kindle i use this more then my ereader orfire i pretty much use it all the timedont get the battery saver app it would sometimes make the tablet freezei also like that on this fire i can have my reading background be a light green color i was using sepia on the other fire this may not be new to the hd fires but it is new to me and i like it,positive

22,i bought this tablet for myyear old son this past year i have spenton a cheap rca tablet andon a google nextbook thenon the hisense pro last year for christmas needless to say all of them have broke since thenfor being under adollars i cant praise it enough in comparison to the other tablets in that price bracket compared to the cheap tables i bought before this tablet is glorioussince i bought it for my son i really appreciate the sturdy structure very easy to hold and use for small hands but it also fits very comfortably in my own hands its actually easier to hold than my own tablet the fire hdxthe sleek back and pointy corners make my hands cramp up i think i dropped it five times on my face before i got the case which makes it a lot easier to holdthe picture looks fantastic for the price range very clear and bright no glare if youve bought cheap tablets before then you know how terrible the glare can be the sound is decent the touch is super easy and sensitive my son has no problems navigating through pocket minecraft added kindle unlimited freetime for kids and i am in lovei have had no problems with any lagging or crashes or even when ive stole it to surf on the interneti made the mistake of buying myyear old andyear old leappad s last year and greatly regret the money trap that comes with it games loaded directly onto the leappad range anywhere fromtoper game if your in the market for buying a tablet for your children you cannot beat this nugget with the free time cheaper full of games books kids movies that personally have my two younger kids drooling over my sons new tabletim waiting for the kids case to come out and it will be perfecton a different note i have thought about buying one for myself just to fit easily into my purse for easy reading when travelingi hope the price stays the same because i will be buying these for christmas gifts for pretty much all my nieces and nephews,positive
23,i love this tablet so far it does everything i need it to do this is my first tablet and im quite happy about it i was using the rd gen kindle its nice that its the same size as it the only drawback is that its hard to hold it up because its heavy i recommend the gb over the gb i think spending the extradollars for more space was worth it also it was nice that your amazon account came preloaded and all my books were ready to go for me as soon as i took it out of the box,positive
24,love love love coming from an apple fan owner of two previous kindles and the loving owner of an ipad mini its extremely fast compared to the original kindle fire and just really fast in general recommended for anyone but dont think it replaces an ipad if anything its a great sidekick and i do want to note how much this product has made me love amazon more and its great for teens because amazon was the first ever online shopping i ever did and the first time i could learn to buy things for myself it rewarding to wait for your products and unwrap them esp when you areand never had much of your own privilege of buying gifts for your family on your own,positive
25,i got mine yesterday and i cant stop playing with iti have a number of tablets and its my third kindle fire but its my firsttabletthat is its outstanding featureits a perfect fit in my hand when playing sudoku or other light games which are most of the games i playthis is going to be my first choice for little games from now onive watched a couple of tv shows on itim used to watching on a larger tablet but theyre fine on thiswhen i start watching my first thought is that im not going to like this small screen and the next thing i know im absorbed in the story and the screen is worldsized just like my larger screens when im watching a tv show or movieits easy to carry walking around the house while watching a show and i like thati listened to a few minutes of an audiobook and that works out nicelythe speaker is fine for that in my quiet houseits good and clear and has enough volumethere have been a few little problemswhen i type in a search phrase either in the browser or in the store about half the time when im a few letters into the description the keyboard disappearsive found that if i wait for whatever page im on to finish loading that doesnt happenim hoping this will be fixed soon in an updatein the meantime its a pretty minor problemive had a lot more and worse problems with ioson my ipad and with windows another problem is that when i adjust the brightness for reading it adjusts for the tablet overall so i have to adjust at the beginning and the end of each reading sessionthis needs to be fixed and it needs to allow lower brightness than it doesit also needs to allow more color options while readingthe sepia reduces contrast too muchthe background is improved but the text is now not dark enoughallowing us to control the text and the background separately would be much betteras it is i probably wont use it for readingi have a paperwhite so thats okay but id like to have been able to do more reading with this thing tooother than that its been very goodi wonder if this will start a new size trend among tabletsi wont be surprised if it doesbarry,positive
26,unboxing video of the kindle simple and shortthis is an amazing tableti upgraded from the original fire hd to this mini tabletwhy well first the original fire hd was getting outdated and a lot of apps i needed wouldnt work on itapps like dish anywhere did not work on the old fire hdnewer apps didnt work well or at all on the older fire oswith that being said i wanted to update to fire osfire osis a big big improvement from previous fire os systemsnew fire customers do need to keep in mind that even though fire os is based on android there is no google playyou have to use the amazon app store but i have never had any problems with thatwith the new fire os my dish network app works now the app store now has more apps and newer appsthe kindle works better with new amazon technologys such as second screen second screen did work on the original fire hd it came as an update but it was very sluggishnow with the new kindle it is fluid and works like it is supposed toanother reason i purchased this tablet was bc of its sizethis tablet will fit in your back pocket or cargo pants very easilyi know i could have got anotherinch tablet but for me theinch is the perfect sizei got into kindles originally because of their sizei dont use my tablet as a computer so i dont want a bigorinch tabletthisinch is actually my favorite size for a media devicei big plus is that amazon now includes the charger block again with their tabletsall formy original fire hd i had to purchase acharger block the block that comes with the smaller kindleinch is smaller which i likethis tablet has a much more powerful processor than the original fire hdit has two extra cores and the difference is very very noticeablethecore processor is great for multitaskingif you use services like prime music prime instant video or any other amazon service these tablets are a must they work much better than android or apple tablets using these servicesfire tablets also run apps like netflix fine so if you dont use prime netflix will work greatthe quality of this tablet is amazing have you ever felt the cheap tablets at best buyif so you know they feel and look like crap this tablet feels and looks like atablet very durable and seems to be very very well built they took time designing the tablet and that can be seen one example is the camera lots of phones and tablets put the lens flat with the back of the phone or tabletthe kindle lens is slightly lower than the back of the tablet why is this importantif you lay your tablet flat this keeps the lens from scratchinglastly i cant stress enough that if you plan to purchase this tablet thinking it is an android tablet ready to use google play and other android services you might be disappointedbut please dont purchase this tablet to leave it a bad review for something its not because its not an android google tabletits a kindle fire hd and its amazing once you get used to it special offers dont bother me plus i have found some great deals and trials through the special offersi recommend not paying the extra to turn off offers but that is just my opinioneditafter my first day using the tablet i can confirm it is a very big and welcomed upgrade over the original kindle fire hdthe screen looks much better yes it is the same resolution but the smaller screen makes it cleareranother function i have been really enjoying is the built in bluetoothi have been playing prime music on the tablet all day over my bluetooth speakersthe original fire hd also had bluetooth but the bluetooth on this new kindle seems to work much much better,positive
27,i may have been spoiled by hubbys nexus devices while only sportingscreens they make the most of the real estate and have fabulous visuals and specs to boot sadly the fire hd fails to meet my lofty expectations from the start it feels thicker clunkier and heavier though it is lighter than the larger nexusthe screen almost looks to be set further into the device its resolution isxppi which is a far cry from thexppi im used to for a stand alone reader that would be fine when a major selling point is full access to amazon prime features like the hd vod service that isnt so fine more on that later both sport corning gorilla glass both have front and rear cameras both have quadcore processorswifi bluetooth and access to a wide array of apps so since one is more expensive than the other youd be inclined to forgive the screen issues and focus on what amazon got right rightwhat amazon got right was the price sold for as low asrecently youd be hardpressed to find a quadcore device of equal build quality for less and with gb of ram it should handle light mobile games email and some light web browsing with aplomb but when you get to the software thats where things go off the rails for me amazon skinned over the lovely android os with their own proprietary features much to the detriment of the user experience perhaps its because im used to a pure android experience but the devices seems seriously hamstrung by the fire os you lose access to the google play store you lose access to a synced chrome and all its bookmarks with no way to import them you lose access to the device synchronicity youre accustomed to and youre forced into an ecosystem that is geared towards amazon consumption at the cost of being truly user friendly i found myself constantly frustrated by trying to do what ive been doing with my android devices for years now only have to try to learn amazons way of doing it instead yuck whats worse is when you get into heavy web browsing downloading or typing you get so much lag you want to fling the thing into the nearest wall all the ports are at the top of the device the single rear speaker is absolutely awful and the camera at mp is positively anemic though it does sport an hdr mode and a wide array of editing tools the pictures will never be anything to write home about especially in low light conditions the screen size is frustrating for me tapping and touching with normal sized fingers and hubby couldnt do squat with his much bigger hubby paws amazon does sport its own app store but more than a few of the versions of the apps available while seemingly identical to their google app and apple app store cousins are usually a few versions behind because lets face it there are two big dogs on the app block and it doesnt make sense to spend a bundle on development for the two little dogs with very little market penetration amazon and windows amazon has also locked the bootloader which means no third party development is available which is another huge upside for normal android devices and a hinderance for kindlesi like having access to my amazon prime benefits i like being able to stream my free video and audio benefits seamlessly i like the kindle features that go above and beyond the kindle apps available for all my other devices i like that it is small enough to drop in my purse and not know its there it seems to be very sturdily built with unobtrusive buttons that dont get hit accidentally and i like the price aside from that there is also plenty to make me say that i doubt id buy a kindle on my own any time soon the proprietary frustrating nature of the os the ads on the lock screen the focus on the amazon experience and not the customer experience the lack of synchronicity the screen and some personal experience the memory on my first device was corrupted and the charging port was borked amazon sent a replacement nextday air but after several rounds with their customer service chat to figure out how to connect the device to my tv for a true hd video experiencedifferent chats got medifferent failed methods i eventually gave up and resigned myself to asubhd screen for the foreseeable future i also dont know how i only havegb of space on a gb device when it arrives too small to download a movie and very little space for apps media or really anything ive used samsung galaxy devices lg devices asus devices and nexus devices kindle is dead last in my user experiencei wanted to like my kindle i wanted one for some time amazon shot for the moon with their kindle devices and instead for me shot themselves in the foot perhaps i expected too much if its for youngsters you have a relatively well built relatively inexpensive device that they can stream the occasional video play a few games and read a few books for a grown up youre better off buying a grown up device i received the above products free of charge from third voice marketingi am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review just my honest opinionmy review is based on my experience with the product andor brand which may differ from yours,neutral
28,pretty neat tablet but not too satisfied camera is not good and the screen breaks easy if drop maybetoinches high got it for christmas and use it formonths now its trashbroken screen will never be covered by their warranty,positive
29,if you are looking for a topnotch ereader forget buying a paperwhitefor less money the hd gives a great and easy reading experience with beautiful color and lightplus all the internet features you need for facebook email web surfing and youtube videosthis cant be beat,neutral
30,this tablet is terriblei ordered it for the conveniently portable size and my sisterinlaw loves her fire hdxhowever this little brother did not live up to expectations at allfirst of all although the hdstarted out working fast downloading and running apps with no problems after just a few minutes of use it began to bog down and lag behindwhile reading a digital publication i tried to scroll down to continue reading the page i was on and it started to lag behindit would not stay with my finger and the page began to move erraticallythen the text blurred and the screen got stuck in betweenpagesafter several seconds it finally caught up but was almost totally unresponsive to my touchi tried removing the apps i had downloaded and reinstalling them to see if that was the problemit worked perfectly for a few minutes again but then went right back to being slow and glitchy againim returning it today,neutral
31,very happy with it so far ive read surfed the web watched tv programs listened to music and taken a few picturesim not that tech savvy and im still getting used to it but i think this is a great product and would recommend it to family and friendsi will update this review at a later date if i run into problems,positive
32,i seriously do not understand the one star reviews if you read the product description which is very through you will understand that this tablet is amazoncentricfor the ability to do immersion reading listening to audio books while the kindle book reader highlights the words have access to prime video and music xray for prime video is amazing do some web browsing shop amazon and play a few games what is there to gripe about the tablet runs very smoothly has a very easy to use interface and lasts me a whole day before needing to be recharged i also love the case it has magnets that actually keep the flap in place in both the closed and open position the little crease in the cover allows the tablet to sit in portrait or landscape i cant imagine a better value for an entertainmentmedia consumption device if you want serious gaming or have major productivity needs then buy a tab s or an ipad both of which cost four times the price or more in case you can not tell by now i am very smitten with myfire hd,positive
33,i bought this for myyear old son this was the perfect purchaseit is small enough for him to carry around yet big enough for me to borrow at timesit even allows him to download a movie to watch in the car where there is no access to wifii love the parental control and freetime featuresi can require him to read books for a given period of time ieminutes before he is able to watch movies or play gamesi can also set it to shut down at a particular time on weekdays and set a separate time for weekendsthere are more than enough books games and apps for him to enjoy,positive
34,okay i will admit it i have always been a kindle skeptic i would consider myself pretty experienced with tablets but they have always been on the android platform i have heard mixed reviews about this particular tablet but let me tell you i was beyond impressed i never thought a little six inch tablet would pack this much punchthis does have a good weight to it which i like i opened this up and the setup process took less thanminutes it synced effortlessly to my amazon account and i can now watch movies look at photos and read my books with no issues i have experienced zero lag even after installing about a dozen apps the layout is a little different than other tablets but it was very easy to figure out everything loads very fast i think one of my favorite features is that it imports my photos to the cloud but has unlimited photo storage for pictures so i can access all of my photos from all of my devices it is great to have them all in one placeobviously this opens books like a dream the camera is pretty good for a tablet my phone has a better camera but i do not expect very high quality photos from a tablet this blew my expectations out of the wateri definitely recommend i received this product for review purposes,positive
35,for a tablet at such an excellent pricecompared to a whoppingfor my ipad i am beyond impressed with my new kindle fire hdthe hd looks pretty great i watched some netflix on it and wow the app store is very intuitive and i even enjoy reading books on it more than on my ipad i was expecting it to be lighter than it is for such a small tablet however it is not uncomfortable to hold even for long periods of timei was unsure about purchasing this with special offers but im very glad i saved the extraand got it with the special offers since they do not bother me the ads are only on the lock screen and home screen and does not affect reading or use of applications i think it is perfect for reading books and enjoying some fun applications as well i would definitely recommend this and think its a fantastic gift for a more than reasonable price i received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review,positive
36,i love this new generation of fire hd ive had kinde nd generation and an ipad mini i sold ipad mini and kept kindle now this fire hd will replace my old kindle now many people who give this devicestar reviews are upset about not being able to use google play store i am a very light app user meaning i only have aboutgames i play and two apps for videos my fire tablet has exactly same apps i have on my android phone amazon app store completely satisfies my needs why is this in my opinion better than ipad and at the same time worse because i use tablet only for watching tv shows on netflix and reading books havingipad just for that is a shame this tablet has a great screen very responsive video quality is amazing booksomg i love amazon libraryeverything is so cheap and as a prime member i get one book of my choice for free once a month super happy if you want to use your tablet for way more than thatlike do some work on it some heavy web browsing or gamingyou probably need to get a regular android tablet because this is not this is kindle fire made for watching videos and reading books primarily for having excess to huge music ebook and video amazon librarythats its main purpose know what to expect when you order it so you dont get disappointed i personally love it very much this great new size is perfect for just throwing it in the handbag and taking it with you everywhere just like you take your phone i highly recommend this tablet for everyone who feels this tablet is enough for them i know its definitely enough for me,positive
37,well to start off this was a decent little tablet that i had bought for my wifethe reason i am writing this review today is that i had the unfortunate experience of having seen the kindle fire hd drop test commercial on tvapparently it can fall off of a car and still workunfortunately with the one i bought that was not the casemy wife dropped it from a distance of aboutft off the ground and it landed flat on its back on a linoleum floor in the amazon brand origami casewhen she picked it up the screen was not cracked at all but there were lines and screen discolorationi email amazon customer service and they said that they would replace it but then i got a second email that stated they needed more informationso i used voice chat with a customer service representative and explained again what happened and that yes it had been droppeddue to it being dropped they would not replace it which i understood so i asked if they could repair it or give me a better price on one and send this one in so it could be refurbishedthey said they do not repair themso then i asked how much could you take off if i sent this broken one in so you could fix it and resell it as refurbishedi believe they quoted me atwhich seemed to be not such a fair dealso i just said no thanks and bought my wife a galaxy tabinchi know that the old galaxy tabthat i had was made with gorilla glass the fire hdcertainly is not as strong as the first generation galaxy tabas a matter of fact when you push on the screen you can feel it indent or give but with the galaxy tab there is no givei had even dropped the galaxy tab on its corner unprotected and it still worked but left a ding cosmeticallymaybe the short fall breaking the hdhas something to do with the tablets weight for its size it feels like a little brick and is quite heavyagain the only reason im reviewing this now is that i saw the drop test commercial and thought oh really just dont assume that you will get a replacement when it does fall as advertised,neutral
38,first of all let me talk about the price amazon is trying to compete with companies like apple and samsung for a spot in the tablet world and amazon found their competitors weak pointthe price the last time i checked you cannot buy an ipad for undernor can you purchase a samsung note for that price either although the hddoes not have the full range of capabilities that the other tablets have it is still an amazing piece for the price one thing that i did not like was the fact that i cannot change the wallpaper having used apple devices all of my life that has been common for me and even though it is kind of a small thing it still might matter to some peoplethe goodamazing pricesize is perfect for on the go peopleamazon customer service is very helpful if you need help operating the tabletmakes a great gift for anyonethe badalthough the amazon music store is good the app store is limitedthe headphone jack must be flawed because it sounds staticy when i plug it inwarningsdo not be fooled by special offers when you buy the tablet for the base price ofit automatically comes with this feature called special offers this gives amazon the right to put ads on your lockscreen although the ads do not interfere with the rest of the tablets features the lockscreen ads can be cumbersome occasionally you can opt out of the special offers formorealso go with theg model because theg model only comes withgigs of storage available to the user,neutral
39,ive used the regular kindle both original fire and fire hdnever liked the firesthought they were too heavy and they didnt quite fit in my handcomfortablyand being a diehard bibilophile i much prefer paper copybut im seriously considering one of theseprossmaller size doesnt make a noticeable difference surprisinglythe picture is very clear which helpsthere are a few apps that are just too small to use well but most do finesuper lightweight compared to kindle fireslight enough to keep in my purse all the time without getting scholiosisi thought the touch screen was more responsive than kindles which sometimes balk at my touchthe sides have this funny angling that makes it extremely easy to holdfits perfectly in my open hand without making my fingers cramp i have ahand span from pinkie to thumb if that helps give you an idea of my hand sizebattery life seems to be about the same as kindle hd but of course will depend on your use and settingswi fi pick up is fine in my house even thru the brick wall to the additionneat new featurein the settings you can change the type font size from small med or largethis is not the font size for books or the internetbut the fonts for the actual kindle the settingstabs and so forththe carousel is still there but if you actually select books they are arranged in either list or grid format with choice of au ti or recentstill no option for grouping by folders also when you go to home what you see are your most commonly used apps and some preloaded things like the camera arranged on one screenswipe down to find the carouselvolume control buttons on one side as with an ipadyour most used apps on on the home pageand at least some of the apps can run in the background like pandora while you use another appconsok it is smaller but still much bigger than most phone screensthe camera still shot quality is only acceptablex mag the attached flower photo was taken outside in full sun at arms lengthits a very peach toned flower by the wayif there is a manual to tell how to use the camera features i havent been able to find it yetno power light to show when its charging or done charging this is probably the biggest disadvantageand the screen reflectivity is still horrible in bright lightusing the camera in full sun is pretty much taking shots in the darkyou wont know what you got until you go back insidesummaryi give itstars for bad camera and lack of charging lightotherwise if you want a cheap tablet for internet access and apps and emergency reading i think this is really goodall the cool colors are great too,neutral

42,first let me say im a selfconfessed gadget junkie i own a myriad of electronics computers tablets ereaders mp players but ive never owned a kindle fire device until now i work quite a bit so usually pocket my iphone itouch and sometimes my ipad minir when leaving for the day ive always been attracted to the compact gadgets based on by lifestyle as hefting a heavy tablet or computer is never easy on the backwhen i heard about the fire hdi was intrigued enough to follow reviews in different forums for the past few days and hunt for any reviews of it on youtube i decided to bite and picked one up at my local best buy store this morning ordered online for instore pickup and had it unboxed and running in less than an hour it synced all my books music and apps that i had previous bought when i owned an android phone logged into my netflix and hulu plus accounts and tried out an episdoe to see how it would play there was absolutely no buffering and the sound quality was great i know some have said it doesnt compare to the other fire tablets but i found it meets and even exceeds my needs ive only begun playing with this little device but i know already it has become one of my favorites and will be coming with me wherever i go looking forward to the holidays and picking up a few of these for family members as the device will be a wonderful gift,positive
43,finally kindle text to speech that fits in your pocket i may need to get a life at some point but until then i can listen to tech books and nist special publications during myhour daily commute this will now take the place of my kindle fire hdxive managed to get through some pretty hefty certification books including shon harris excellent cissp allinone exam guidepage tome cover to covertimes during my commutethe only wish list items i have would be add areading speed or change the control to a slider to broaden the range of values sincecan be too fast for dense legal or technical content i use ezpdf reader pro for the slightly faster reading speed when listening to pdf files ignore pictures lines and symbols that might cause the tts to freeze or to misidentify the item such as currency for a poorly selected bullet item symbol or read underscore underscore underscore underscore for a header or footer line allow the disabling of acronym and abbreviation assumptions such as dr as doctor g as grams etc deearrh and gee would let the reader apply the correct context it does make for interesting reading when doctor is substituted for ever instance of disaster recoveryim totally thrilled with the new smaller form factor,neutral

47,i was sooo so excited upon hearing about the new kindle releaseswho can beat that especially for a great brand budget tablets and ereaders exist but i was never willing to sacrifice a better brand with better service even for the cheaper price basically all i wanted a tablet for was to read on im a librarian and frequently use our ebooks database as well as netgalley and kindle books ive been thinking about a kindle fire for ages but never wanted to shell out the money for it just to read on while the paperwhites are inexpensive they have limited features and i like that i can go into my goodreads app as well as facebook and web browse its very helpful for me when searching for new books to read and reviewingas i am not looking to do any heavy duty web work blogging emailing video watching music listening etc on here those functions are nice if i ever would need them but i cant talk about their functionality because right now i dont intend to use itif you are looking for an inexpensive kindle that is in a tablet form not the paperwhite this is absolutely perfect there are a few issues with being able to download my books that are not from kindle but after a couple of web searches i was able to figure it out if you are a dedicated reader that uses several platforms this is worth checking into it is a way better deal than shelling outfor an ipad mini if youre only intending to read on itim thinking about having our library purchase several of these to have on hand because they are so affordable and nice for readers i just cant get over how perfect this little tablet will be for reading on especially when traveling,positive
48,so far so good i have had my fire hdtablet for aboutweeks now and so far i love it in my opinion it is the perfect size its big enough to watch movies and surf the web but small enough to easily toss in your backpack purse or even your back pocket it is a little thicker and heavier compared to other small tablets some might think of this as an advantage and others as a disadvantage i personally think its an advantage if it was any thinner it would feel very fragile the screen image quality is amazing everything looks crisp and vibrant the speed of the tablet is decent it is very snappy when switching apps and browsing the web when i watch amazon prime videos it loads almost instantly without buffering the app selection isnt as large as other android tablets that use the google play store or apples app store but there is still a large number of apps that you can download its definitely larger than microsofts app store i have owned ipads an ipad mini galaxy tablets a microsoft surface laptops notebooks and all kinds of smartphones this fire tablet is by far my favorite device mainly because it was onlymost of my other devices costor more and werent a whole lot nicer or faster im not saying this fire tablet is the best tablet out there but it is definitely the best tablet out there for in summary here are my pros and consprospricedecent speedgreat graphicsportabilitydecent sounddurabilityamazon prime integrationchoice of multiple colorsunlimited cloud storage for picturesconsthicker and heavierapp selectioncant customize wallpaperssimple maybe even boring designbuy this tablet you wont regret it if you do you can always return it ps for those who are debating buying the tablet without the special promotions i recommend not doing so get the cheaper one because most likely you wont even notice them after a while if in the future you really dont like the promotions you can always log into your amazon account and pay an extrato disable the promotions,neutral

51,let me say first that this is my th fire and ive also had a k so ive been around the block with the amazon family im least pleased with this onethe speakers are wonky its very slow and im not sure the brain isnt about to blow its notably smaller than the fire s and s which isnt necessarily a good thing and the software is generally awkward i expect its about to take a trip back being it wont start now and its only a few days old the replacement is even worse than the first and it wont even turn on now that its hit the internet be warned that it is very very difficult almost impossible to reach fire customer service these days i only fell over it by accident the first time and now i cant find it at allvery disappointed in this amazon product i think ill go buy another fire,negative

55,i loved mine i really did but it had one serious flaw the standby battery drain every time i turned it on the battery had lostnothing i did helpedpowering off removing special offers turning the brightness down turning off notifications keeping it in airplane mode except to download a book deleting all my apps even re registering etc i had planned to call customer service this week but one night the battery hadleft and the next morning it was deadi had only managed to read aboutof my book so i de registered it and returned it to the amazon kiosk at the mall i intended to buy a new one without special offers but the kiosk didnt have any i will order a new one directly from amazon sometime my dil loves the one i gave her for her birthdayedited the second kindlea new one not refurbished is okay i charged the battery it lastedhours andminutes used only to read a book i think that is probably acceptable i agree with the people who think it is too heavy for its size i wish the app could tell me the hours minutes of actual use not just the percentage of life remaining at least one of the screensavers is too dark to see the keypad where you type in the pass code with brightness atand i would like to turn off the sleep wake feature,neutral

57,perfect price and great if you have kids i got this tablet just for my daughter and for me just to surf the net i really like the parental aspects of this device you can block anything that is not for a child but still be able to access the apps and other things with out having to hover over your child worried about what he or she is viewing i also like the size its a little bit bigger than a notephone in all its a great purchase for those reasons above,neutral

59,ive been sitting trying figure out why i like this thing so much better than my hdxit isnt as thinthe screen isnt aswell perfect it feels quite a bit heavierive been at a loss for a while now but i think maybe another reviewer said it bestthis thing feels great in your hand it feels substantial but not too heavy the screen is good enough so that when you use it you never think about the screenwell unless youre thinking something like i cant believe i got this screen for a hundred bucksin a lot of ways it reminds me of a paperback noveli loved those things by the waymore to the point i love reading because of those things i propose we all start thinking of this model kindle as the paperback novel of kindlesit is a more portable more affordable variation on the originalin just the same way the paperback novel was for the common person so too is the hdit is a good tablet with good performance a good screen and decent battery lifeand oh by the way it is one most people can affordand i will say something else which is im not sure any other hardware company could build a tablet this good and sell it at this pricei think amazons hardware designers are just that goodas someone who cares for value and who has done a good bit of research on so called value tablets let me save you some timethere are no other value tabletsnot this goodnot nearly this good this tablet makes all other value tablets look like a foolish waist of moneyplus it does things even my nexuscould never do like fit comfortably in my pocketi bought this device with every intention of trying it out for a week just so i could understand it a bit bettereven that decision was spur of the momenti chose the hd over a paperwhitegotta say i think i nailed that decisionalso i think i will be keeping this thing much longer than a week,positive

feedback or ambient light sensor not deal breakers for me in this price rangequick overviewthe kindle fire hdis an entry level tablet that really packs a punchi wanted to buy myyear old daughter a tablet for her birthday and really vacillated as to what to buyif you go too cheap all you get is an outmoded slow and clunky piece of crap that wont hold up over timeif you go the way of the basic ipad mini youre giving a kidpiece of technology to knock around in their backpackwhen the fire hdwent on sale forduring cyberweek the timing couldnt have been better and i went for iti havent had this thing for a long time granted but ive seen plenty of tablets in my day and for a kidand even an adultthis thing rocksthis may not be the latest and greatest technology but you would be hard pressed to find a tablet this refined and with this good of a user experience at a similar price pointlong reviewfirst and foremost when you buy the kindle fire hdyou are getting a sweet piece of well thought out technologythe thing arrived in exactlydays from purchase and was mailed in the nondescript cardboard packaging that amazon usually uses for medium sized booksinside was a simple cardboard container that amazon uses for their frustrationfree packagingbut when i opened the frustrationfree package i was more than surprised to see that they hadnt skimped on the presentationthe box for the kindle hdhas an appleworthy simplistic beautyyou shouldnt judge a book by the cover but the look of a gift is incredibly important and the quality of the packaging absolutely reflects the attitude of the manufacturer towards the productamazon hadnt skimped here and my daughters eyes lit up when she looked at the boxinside the boxinside the box you will find the carefully packaged kindle itselfa microusb charge cord and quick start cardthe device itself is machined well without any dogeared edges or superficial flawsthe device is made of plastic but it feels solid in your handsunlike most lowend electronics the onoff button and the volume buttons also have a firm feelthe chargesync cord easily fits into the kindles microusb portthere is no jiggling and no difficulty placing the cordin the past i have bought lower end electronics with cheap usb ports that dont quite fit or easily breakthis does not seem to be the case hereset uponce you turn on the device the tablet walks you through setting up your local wifi and you enter your amazon account informationonce done all your content on amazon is available to you all kinds of media and appsyou can then decide how you want to set up the devicefire os is not standard android but anyone who is used to technology the learning curve is easyi did have to consult the amazon website for a few particular things but basically once you set the device up you will beset to gothe user interface is elegant and a great skin on androidthe limiting factor of course is that you are stuck with the amazon app storethis is rather robust at this point but still lacks the sheer number and diversity of programs that you can find on google playnevertheless the kindle fire series gives youunprecedented ease in accessing all of your amazon contentadditionally this tablet is no toyit can do anything a runofthemill android tablet can dosetting up a kids account with appropriate restrictions is a little more complicated but well worth itim all for giving children major leeway but having the web at your fingertips with no restrictions on a device that can be used in private is a little too much responsibilitythe fact is that the kids accounts can be configured to give them incredible leeway but you can also restrict total amount of use time restrict the apps they can use and the ratings of the media that they can viewfor a parent this is a godsendthere is lots of help on the tablet itself when you set up a kids account and there is additional information on the webthe screeni dont know why anyone would complain about the screen no this is not the retina display of the latest ipad minibut atppi it beats the basic ipad mini which is atppi and comes incredibly close the the latest ipad airsppigiven theinch screenppi is quite an incredible amount of resolutioneven small text comes out as crisp and unpixilatedthe rendering of color the brightness and the viewing angles are incredible for a device that would cost twice this much let alone at this price pointis the screen as good as the one on the basic ipad miniit sure seems so to my eyesmaybe its the smaller form factor but there is no real compromise herethe screen is incredibly responsive to gesturesso far there is little or no lagthe tablet has yet to freeze or staggeri realize i have not been using it for more than a couple of days but i havent seen a better screen on anything in the sub categorykudos to amazon for thisrendering of movies and complex games was far better than i ever expectedthis is a media consumption device after all and it does this incredibly wellas an old guy i would like a bigger screenbut for the ipodsmartphone generation watching media on the small screen is second natureditto on web surfing and ebooksthe screen will render web pages full size with type that is readable for me only because i wear progressive lenseswith appropriate eyewear however web surfing is a pleasant enough experiencei would prefer reading my ebooks using a larger form factor but they are serviceable on the deviceat agemy daughter isnt bothered in the leastthat said with ainch screen this tablet is not much larger than most phablets out there so if i were getting a tablet for myself i would have opted for a larger form factoruser experiencein reading professional reviews of the tablet before purchasing a lot of ink was spilled regarding the wimpiness of the hd s mediatek mtghz processor and paltrygb of ramthe first observation i would make is that it is ridiculous to expect that a tablet in this price range will purr and hum like the topoftheline galaxy tab or supedup ipadsure the hdmay suffer in comparison on some benchmarksits still atablet nottotabletstillin my hands so far the performance has been more than snappythere is very little lag i think i have more lag on my iphone s for some tasksraw hardware is absolutely an important consideration but it is meaningless unless there is a good marriage between hardware and softwareamazon has optimized the experience for those who are interested in amazon content and have really done this brilliantlyit may well be that the higherline kindles do their stuff even better but even if that is the case the experience with the kindle hdis still greati will have to see how things go as the tablet gets filled up with apps or there is some serious multitasking going onbut so far so goodimportant issuestrade offswhat are the downsides herewell atthere had to be some compromises atmegapixels the rear camera is serviceable but by no means perfecti agree with most of the reviews i read previously the camera takes too long to focus and lowlight pictures are definitely blurryweighing in atounces the hdis something of a brick by modern standardsthe larger hdxis onlyounces heavier and has a larger screen and longer battery lifeclearly the lower end components simply weight morebattery life is slated at onlyhoursi havent tried this in real life yet but most companies overestimate battery lifeto keep costs down amazon had to make some decisions and clearly they opted for an older heavier lowerend battery to achieve thisstillhours at full tilt would have been pretty amazing battery life a few short years ago so its still not too badthe hdonly has a mono speakeraudio on these kinds of devices can never be truly high end theres no way to get a fullrange speaker on something this smallthe sound though is fine for a speaker of this size but its clearly a compromisesingle band wificlearly this will slow down the web but i didnt notice this at all using amazons silk browserno issues with download times but that all depends on your networklow memory on thegb model after accounting for the os and basic apps this apparently leaves only aboutgb of memory are left over for content and additional appsgb can store aboutsongs orphotos atmb per photonot badbut it takes aboutgb to store a movieso if you dont install any apps you could possibly storemovies on yourgb hdnot greatand sadly theres no microsd card slot for memory expansionthen again the purpose of this device is really streamingyou are allowed to cache movies for later viewing but the kindle is really meant to stream content not act as a repository for ityou could opt for thegb hdbut thatll cost youafter buying the tablet though i think buying the extra memory is well worth the cost of the upgradegiven cost constraints amazon has left out some common features seen on midrange and higher end android devicesthere is no gps no nfc near field communication for close proximity neartouch transfer of data with other devices no haptic feedback that buzz you feel when you type into the keyboard and no ambient light sensor allows for automatic adjustment of screen brightness among other thingsnone of these missing items is a deal breaker for me at this price pointi think the trade offs were reasonable to keep the low price point eg id rather have the better screen than the nfc haptic feedback etcgps would have been a nice touch but it is less useful without gg lte service which is not an option on this productfire osthis is both a pro and a con for this deviceon the one hand fire os is optimized to provide a great amazoncontent experiencethere is a great marriage of hardware and software hereon the other hand fire osis less customizable and less user configurable than stock androidits not that amazon hasnt added value here but in adding an excellent amazon experience you are stuck with choices that you may not have wanted to makethe interface is elegant and i believe enjoyable to use but its locked down and some usersespecially those who like to tinker a lot with their interfacewill not appreciate this factconclusioni was far more impressed with the kindle hdthan i could have imaginedit is a lowcost product that really delivers on a high end experienceit is certainly not a highend tablet but amazon packed a lot of value into the productyou get a lot more tablet than you purchasedif you are looking for a device for one of your children and you dont want to sacrifice an arm and a leg to the technology gods this ones for you if you are looking for a great holiday gift for someone who is entrenched in the amazon universe or are looking for an entrylevel kindle this just might be the onethis is by no means a highend tablet but it is insanely good for the price,positive
61,i had thekindle fire hdinch and i loved it when i saw that there was a new cheaper pink fire hd coming out i had to get oneive been playing with it for awhile now and i love it even more than my old fire first its pink the screen is very responsive like the old one everything works quickly like the old one and it has two cameras unlike the old one the front camera is basically the same quality as the camera on myhowever the rear camera which was absent on theseems pretty high quality it takes nice clear photos also my old apps work fine on this kindlealso i love the feel of this one it fits well in the hand it has a nice heft to it that tells you its not cheap junk but its not so heavy that its going to wear out your handoverall i have no complaints i figured that i wouldnt being such a devoted fire tablet follower i dont think you can go wrong with anything in the kindle lineupupdateafter a full day of playing with it i still have no plans to downgrade my review to four stars however i will say that i have now noticed a few of the quirks others were complaining about first off i have discovered a few apps that wont play on this kindle fortunately all the major ones work also the battery life is a little shorter than my original kindle fire hdspeed and responsiveness are barely if at all inferior to original hd volume is lower but you have to remember that the smaller size necessitates one less speakerthat might seem like i found a lot of problems but the problems are extremely minor plus the tablet costsif you got the gb like i did considering the tiny size and price tag these small flaws are perfectly acceptable in my opinionlove it,neutral
62,what an incredible subtablet i saw that these were available as a preorder had a bit overin gift cards burning a hole in my account and my daughter had been hinting that she would like a new tablet i seriously considered thefor a little more but after thinking about her usage habits and the way she does what she does online i went with theand a day after it arrived discovered i had hit a homerunshe loves the tablet she loves the size and she loves the color citron she had a tablet before a fairly awful piece of equipment that cost as much as this less than a year ago and was so bad that she never bothered using it much she has had the firehdwith her since it arrivedthe specs are good but dont really tell the whole story if that was the case then the noname chinese tablet i bought her last year would have been great it wasnt this tablet has good specs and more importantly works well everything she does it just breezes through no lag no hanging up or other undesirable behavior the battery life is great much much better than the chinese tablet with a battery rated at a similar capacityin the end i was hesitant to go with this tablet the specs were good but not impressive lots of chinese tablets have similar specs at a similar price the size had me really concerned i just assumed that the smaller size was more of a cost cutting method to get the price underi was dead wrong this tablet is handy and works well that means that it gets used a lot which in the end is the true measurement of value and this one stands tall,negative
63,i purchased thegigabyte version on sale fordollars without special offers thegig version wason sale without special offers what made it something i couldnt pass up was the offer of a payment plan which i agreed to and so i made the purchase having charged me thedollars the email they sent me now said i had bought the gb version i tried to cancel the purchase they said i could not i was indeed sent angig version which i could have gotten forrealizing they had just ripped me off forbucksi proceeded to dispute the sale and recover the thing i had actually bought agig version at the price id bought itand in the way id bought it on the payment plan after days of explaining and arguing with mental deficients with a certain almost laughably greedy bent i at least got what i had paid for it wasnt easy by any means and i through some amazing zeal to take from me anything they couldthey did take away the payment deal and have charged me all at once i should mention that they also took a bit of my sanity also that seemed to be the plan explaining the obvious over and over and over again to those who barely listen and comprehend less is not funnew egg will be getting more of my business whenever possible a part of me now hates amazon they took alot of my time a large part of a good deal from me and lost a friend you suck amazon and im a prime member,neutral
64,what i didnt realize about the gb was that over half of that was used up on systemoperations got these for two of my children they cant keep any more than a game or two and a movie on the device without the low storage warning coming up which it does constantly i am forever having to delete what little i can from the stupid thing so that they can use them it also kicks you off of wifi any time the storage warning comes oni currently have a kindle that i love but these little tablets are very disappointing if you are looking to purchase be smart and upgrade to the higher memory i wish i would have,negative
65,up until now i have been a confirmed kindle junkie i loved my kindle fire but right out of the box this one was slow it takes betweenandseconds every time to load my library and the carousel the back arrow button takes me out of the book not to the last location and it just now froze while i was trying to shut it down to see if that would fix the problems each of the last three kindles ive purchased the paperwhite gave it away a regular kindle sitting in a cabinet and this one have just gotten worse i dont know if this is an isolated incident or an indication of the future but i think this is my th kindle several of them were warranty replacements inyears im not going to continue spending money on these readers that dont last very long even when they are working correctlyi just now got off the phone returning this hd,negative

71,not a happy customer sideloading apps removes functionality the fire os is inferior to android os in terms of usability furthermore i am inhibited from using my google ecosystem on the fire osworst of all the kindle is pretty much a window into the shopping world of amazon and i am constantly reminded that i need to buy things rather than being able to use the tablet simply for work purposes i do not recommend,positive
72,the sheer value of this device cannot be understated i got thegb model and it doesnt feel like a single penny wastedtheinch screen is a bit small but wider than most phones of the same height and better suited for browsing reading and viewing media the clarity and colors in the screen are simply amazing for the price any other device atwould be lucky to look half as goodthe device feels a bit thicker than it maybe should be but as a result feels solid in your hand almost like a real paperback book i feel like if i dropped it it wouldnt break immediatelysometimes the software hiccups a bit but i havent noticed any significant slowdown it runs most games just finethe battery does what it promises and lives abouthours of useagain foror justfor the gb model this cant be beat,positive
73,bought for my toddler to watch netflixyoutube on trips and outings the price was phemomenal and i had it in mind to purchase a second for myself much to my chagrin this product is unacceptable for any adult with expectations of a goodgreat operating systemsturdy device solid weight but not too heavy my largest complaint is that its more useful as a remote control for amazon shopping more than anything else there is no google play store just copies of apps that you would commonly find the freetime app for kids is more annoying and obtrusive what is the point of a kids app that isnt intuitive for children who can not yet read and the bargain basement versions of apps crash more frequently than cellphone and other tablet versions its stylish has some interesting features email docs directly to the fire but in my opinion too much of the os is devoted to continued shopping on amazon even when you payaddl dollars to turn the screensaver adds off,neutral
74,for a first tablet this works perfectly for mei purchased this for one reason to be able to read ebooks in bed where its warm i have not been fond of reading stuff on the screen of my pc so i wasnt all that certain the fire would work for me but it works wonderfully i have already spent hours reading on it i have had the fire for about two weeks the fact that i can also watch nba games on this device and the picture is hd clear is a fabulous bit of icing on my cakethe camera seems to work just fine i discovered the selfie viewholy cats when did my nose get this big i can transfer photos to my pc easily not the nose one i had forgotten about the videotaking capacity and today was horrified to discover that id recorded a second video when i first got the fire which was the quintessential old person with new technology show including frighteningly clear mumbled narration so that works the deletion function works really well toofor people who are technologically adept yeah i cant tell you what you want to know about this devicebut even considering how low my expectations were for any ebook reader i am exceedingly delighted with my new toy,positive
75,i purchased this small kindle fire as a supplemental ereader for when i was too lazy to use my surfacehowever after playing with this adorable little tablet i am pleasantly surprised at just how capable it iswhile the device looks a little chunky the weight feels appropriate in the hand and is distributed evenly across the device the screen while onlyinches across is absolutely stunning for watching movies the userinterface is what you can expect from amazons proprietary forked android software but unlike previous iterations of the kindle fire the transitions seem much smoother and allaround zippierthe speaker on this tablet is not the best nor is it the worst if i had to draw a comparison it is probably onpar with many highend tablets fromthat were quadruple the price appstore selection is okay and you still have the option of sideloading android apks onto the device if the appstore doesnt have themfor the price you pay you are getting a hardworking bundle of fun that literally fits into your pocket amazon did a great job designing this device,neutral

77,i cannot tell you how much i love the kindle fire hdthe clarity of the screen is extremely impressive for as small as it is that part surpassed all my expectations it has convenient volume buttons on the side and from what i can tell the speaker quality is pretty good for something so tiny it fits perfectly in my purse so i can take it anywhere with me and it is on the light side so it doesnt weigh my bag downmy all time favorite feature on this is the goodreads button i have been saying for a few years now how much easier it would be if ereaders synced right up to goodreads and it finally happened instead of logging onto goodreads to update my progress or to add a new book to my currently reading shelf all i have to do is tap the screen hit the goodreads button and i can update everything from there it even tells me about how long it takes the average reader to read the book im currently on maybe its the book nerd in me but i was so excited about that feature that i literally shouted out loud in excitement when i saw itanother feature that spoke to the bibliophile in me was the related books feature as you are on the home screen scrolling through books it will show you a few other books you may be interested in purchasing based on the subject of that book i received this in exchange for an honest review and myhonest opinion is that compared to the original kindle fire with theinch screen that i already had this is by far my favorite one i highly recommend it if you are mainly using it for reading you will get over its small size rather quickly when you see the amazing features and incredible screen quality,positive
78,this has quickly become my favorite tablet i own every version of the kindle lineup from the original kindle fire right up to the hdxand hdxinch i also have an ipadand an ipad mini both of which are gathering dust because i prefer to use the kindle hdxwhich is lighter faster and easier to transfer files directly from my pc i did not expect the hdto be as good as it is but now i can’t do without it it is easy to hold and transport and fits nicely into a small bag the screen clarity is excellent wifi is faster than previous versions and the sound is much better than i expected in fact i think music sounds better on the hdthan the hdxwhich by the way is the only amazon tablet i have regretted buying i should have returned the hdx because the blue haze around the edges made the device virtually unusable comparing the hdand the hdxi would say the hdis far better in quality and less than half the price of the hdx at least when i bought the hdx last year moreover the hdhas both rear and front cameras and while i don’t use them much i find the picture capability suits my limited purposes such as scanning receipts and other documents battery life is comparable with previous versions not better or worseone other point is worth making since i haven’t heard other reviewers comment on it text on the hdis remarkably readable before i bought the fire i feared that text would too small to read on ainch screen but the software upgrades have made a huge difference reading newspapers and magazines on the fire is a real pleasure the text size automatically adjusts to the screen so that if you enlarge text you can read everything in one screen rather than seeing portions of a line as before the same thing is true with documents especially if you use the wps office on the fire i can read my word documents just as easily on ainch screen as on theonei am very happy with the fire hdthe hdxis still the king of amazon’s tablets and it has replaced my laptop when i travel the fire hdis a close second don’t hesitate to buy it you won’t be disappointed and you will be surprised how quickly it will become your preferred device,positive
79,good for travel and consuming amazon content i wanted this small fire for when i fly and want to watch tv or movies most of the content provided by the airlines is old or low quality since i have a prime account i can choose from a fair selection to load for freei was pleasantly surprised that even the good mode gives a pretty clear picturei tested it with the pilot episode of the sopranosits a good picture took just below mbi got the gb fire so i can easily fitsimilar episodes which would cover any domestic trip including airport stopsone warning video has an expiry date which for the sopranos was three daysoverall performance was goodi was impressed by the email app that came with it i found and set up my office email no problem its not thin and light rather heavynot for carrying around with you in a pocket for long times its a limited android the apps available without rooting or side loading are not extensive youtube worked wellthe biggest weakness is that it doesnt have google apps or google docs the app store is small id recommend it ifyou are a prime member andyou want it mainly to consume amazon content andyou dont need google appsbest part it is cool to be able to download for free so many videos and prime music keeping in touch with email and the officetype suite apps you can buy to view office docs i got mobisystems office suitepro and when a coworker sent me a word doc attachment to my email it opened easilyalso basic photo apps and of course books are there i use apple devices normally so it did take a day to get used to using the android style interfaceit automatically loaded my kindle books no problemwifi connectivity worked welli would actually rate thisand a half stars with half a star off for missing a broad range of android apps especially google apps,neutral
80,very disappointed i purchased my fire new a few weeks ago a couple of days after i purchased it the screen would go black while i was trying to play a game or view anything online i had to continuously restart it by pressing the power button i noticed that the problem got worse if i was hand holding it if it was laying on a flat surface it would still shut off on its own but not as frequentlyi did thesecond restart i did ittimes and the problem continued i chatted with a customer service person at the amazon site while she was very nicehelpful the problem continued basically my kindle firehd is almost impossible to use as i cant view anything for more thanseconds without it going black then switching to the recommended ads screen i tried disabling this feature thinking it might help but the problem continuesi purchased an offbrand android based inexpensive tablet for my kid and it works perfectly compared to my fire my wifes old offbrand android based tablet also works flawlesslyi really wanted to like this tablet but i am truly frustrated with it my next step will be to contact customer service yet again im seriously thinking about giving upand returning it,negative
81,i am not a computer masteri am a middle aged mom who likes to read surf the internet do some facebooking and messagingso perfect is not so important for me i see no problems or drawbacks with this producti love iti have other kindlesthis one is just a little larger than my phone and does so many things i love to dogreat size for pocketting or pursingthe portability meets my needs perfectlyloving my newest kindle,positive
82,my old tablet died this was a gift from my husband best husband ever this amazon fire hd does it all without breaking the bank everything loads instantly plays perfect without lagging is very bright clear and quick seriously worth every penny i love the kindle freetime my grandson can play without any worries thank you amazon and my darling husband,positive
83,the device is good for an adult with an account or possibly for one device shared amongst family membersunfortunately my daughter bought this with her birthday money and amazon does not have good programming options for children in a household with their own deviceso after speaking with a rep from amazon three times it has been determined that these are my three options and their flawsthe free time appis good for controlling some things like books music and some apps however it limits the child to those items onlyunder the free time app they can not take photos videos skype or any other fun apps they would enjoyparental controlsunder the parental controls you can not turn off the cloud option in booksthis allows the child to see all your books in your librarythey can swipe between the two indiscriminately this eliminates the need to choose which books you choose to download to the device as they can read all of themset up their own accountif you have prime as i do you can not share it you can share prime for shipping but not videos books etc so that membership fee looses valueif you purchase a book for your child you have to gift or loan it to themyou will also need to set up an email for the child as wellamazon is a big company and i am disappointed that they cant do this better,negative
84,oh my god i am so in love with my kindle i was so scared to clickpurchased but i did my research on youtube and read a few feedback from people who purchased the kindle and was soldits the perfect size its bigger thanmy samsung galaxy noteand smaller than your average tablet so its right in between thescreen size is perfect for reading idownload all my favorite apps its really cool,positive
85,constantly freezes and sometimes the screen does not work when i touch it it also does not turn on when fully charged every once in a while i have an ipad mini and i do not have any of these issues i exchanged it a few days after i noticed the issues but unfortunately the second one i received had the same issues,negative
86,i recently purchased myself this th generation kindle firehd device during thanksgiving as an upgrade over my st generation kindle firefirst things first you will want to get yourself a case for this as its its at a size that feels awkwardly big and small at the same time and you dont want to accidentally drop it which is easy since it also felt heavier than i would expect for something that sizehowever itll probably be difficult to find a case for this device in stores due to its unconventional sizei tried at best buy and a couple stores but eventually ordered a moko fire hdcaseslim folding cover from amazon a week later and it does the jobbuild quality wise this device feels solidit doesnt bend or feel plasticlikespeedthis thing is fast at least way faster than my old kindle wasits quick to start and very responsivereadingslightly smaller than my old kindle it will display less words per pageeasy to read just like my old kindlevideothe video on this thing is awesomehd quality and very sharpmy only complaint with the videos is that theres not enough space on the device for me to download any hd movies for offline viewingid thinkgbs would be enough but with the few movies i tried to download it complained about spacewhen i tried downloading in lower quality it workedeither i need to try a shorter movie or not download in hdas far as watching streams though its great and works flawlesslysoundim not qualified for rating sound since i have a hearing disability but when i plug in my earbuds and listen to prime music it sounds greatas far as the speakers they work and i can hear it when its turned up all the wayas far as quality of that internal speaker i think its suffice but youll probably be like me and use earbudsappsi only installed a few apps on this thing like youtube twitch spotify pocket etc and they work fine just like they would on an android devicecamerai only took one picture with the front facing camera and it was alrightfortunately my image didnt break the devicei dont intend to really take pictures with my kindle and i havent bothered taking any photos with the back facing camerafor simple photos i think its more than acquitbattery lifeso far it seems to be pretty good with battery life but has a little bit less capacity than my old kindle had but considering that this does much more stuff and last hours and hours and hours before requiring a charge im not worried at all about itabout the ads there are ads on the lock screenmeaning nothing more than that which you simply swipe to unlock thatsswipe notoryoure not forced to buy anything or click thru a bunch of surveys and i wouldnt bother paying extra to have them removedthey arent annoying or intrusive and you only see them on the lock screenif you liked an ad that you swiped past you can view them under offers in the menushoppingshopping on this thing is easyi purchased my case for this kindle via from this kindlei also purchased a few kindle booksthe whole experience was straight forward and easyfor those who want to set restrictions due to children etc there are settings you can set but i havent really played with themamazon prime servicelets all be honest here the kindle fire is really an amazon prime consumption device obviously if youre not utilizing amazon prime then this devices killer features will mostly be overlookedsure you can watch youtube on it but the prime service is what really makes this device rockwith a prime subscription youll have access to all sorts of music and videos that without id have a hard time justifying purchasing a kindle fire over a generic minitabletoverall im very satisfied with my kindle fire hdpurchase and it has been at my side pretty much since purchase effectively replacing my old kindleprosfast response softwarehardwarehd video playbackgreat with amazon primebuild quality feels solidaffordableconsheavier than i expectedkind of an awkward size like an oversize smart phone hard to find cases fornot enough memory to download hd movies for offline viewing at least for me,neutral
87,this is my third kindle i had the first generation then the hdthen this one i did a lot of research and comparison shopping before i bought this one i was torn i wanted something smaller than theand in this case it was the only one of any brand that was smaller than thebut the hdxwas a lot sleeker than this one this one has got some bulk to it surprising bulk for such a compact size and its boxy compared to the hdxhowever i stuck to my desire for a smaller kindle and i am not disappointed at all i love it i really like reading magazines on it for such a small screen theyve done a great job of presenting the magazine pages in a way that makes them clear and easy to read and the resolution wow i can see a huge difference between my old hdand this one this one is truly beautiful i guess some are bummed that this one doesnt have the mayday function on it but that has never appealed to me a chat session or email is just fine with me this one has turned out to be everything i wanted and has surpassed my expectations in many ways well done amazon once again,positive
88,warning does not support google anything i even tried getting the apks to do it myself but it wont support half of those either i didnt really do my research on this because i didnt really care that much but for anyone else if you dont like any apps associated with google then this would be ok for you but there are other tablets out there that would still be better this is essentially a glorified kindle which would be fine but its not really advertised that way,positive
89,i purchased this tablet for myyear old son as a substitute for the ipad he favored i thought this would be a good buy given that you can place more restrictions on it than the ipad and with three kindle free time it seemed more kid friendly we have been using the tablet for a month now and i have to say i am very disappointed to start the memory on the kindle is crap every app game book pretty much everything has to be downloaded to work it states that the device hasgb of memory but my kindle is currently at gb used and says to only have mb left that doesnt add up to gb its frustrating since you have to constantly delete items in order to connect to wifi and use the tablet then when you go to delete items the majority of the apps taking up space are all system applications that you cannot delete and honestly dont even use it would be nice to delete those preloaded apps to get more space for the apps you want it would be better if you could add an sd card or some type of external storage device to add more space but you cant i am getting ready to send this back and purchase the ipad at least the internal storage space can handle all of the downloads needed,positive
90,i love this kindle i have bought a bunch of tablets including the st generation asus transformer ipadsamsung tabnexusiii and this one this is cheapest one in my army of tablets but surprisingly it might be the most powerful one its wifi is so good that i can watch hd prime video at every corner of my house i purchase it mainly for my kids my daughter loves it and always calls it little ipad and said the little is better than the big ipad i dont think amazon is making good money from thegadget it should be a trap to steal your bucks when you use it to buy books audiovideo contents i have been prime member for years even we can watch so many videos for free i still bought a couple of movies for my kids anyway it is a good buy especially for young members of my family,positive
91,i bought my daughter the kindle fire for her birthday and a week later it no longer worksit just keeps turning on and off i cant even reboot the kindle because it doesnt stay on long enough to reboot itvery disappointed because i was going to purchase a kindle for myself but id rather pay extra money for something more reliable,negative
92,i have an older kindle fire and i was looking forward to an update unfortunately the one i got wouldnt ever connect to wifi so i couldnt even make it through setup amazon wasnt helpful and didnt offer to replace it with another unit so back it goes it might be a good product but sadly i will never know,positive
93,this tablet is perfect for mei like to take photos and share them via emaili trust amazon products and the new fire hd tablet is exactly what i needed as i dont want to payor more per month for a cell phone with a costly planand i dont have to use my old camera and then download the pics to my pc anymoreall the photos i take on my fire hd tablet get stored in the amazon cloudno more photo albumsi can send the photos directly from the fire tablet to my family and friends via emailand the fire hd is a great price and takes great photoseverything you need to change the photo comes with the tablet you can adjust crop rotate the photos etc and its easy to use,positive
94,perfect size and weight for travel for watching and reading in bed at night excellent video and audio quality very userfriendly and easy to set up apps nice reading quality with builtin tools that are interesting and fun to use a quick dictionary for example just by highlight a word with your finger or highlighting simply by dragging your finger down the text i love it plus forgive me but its really cute i love the size,positive
95,a little background information about me ive never owned a tablet though at one point i borrowed a friends nd edition ipad and that was a joy to use i have an iphoneand recently the newandplus came out i love my phone and i love the size of my phone and how easily it fits in my hand i use my phone for everything including my nightlyhour reading sessions the reading sessions on theinch screen of my iphone are especially painful for me so i was debating about upgrading to theplus and finally being able to read on a decent sized screen however besides reading i didnt want a bigger phone i really like my phone the way it is but the reading was difficult what to doand then enter the fire hdi am so happy i immediately drove down to my local big electronic store the day it came out they had some in stock but they werent even out on display they kept trying to sell me the older editions haha but i waited an hour or so while they found one still in the back apparently it hadnt made its way to the floor yet now i dont have to upgrade my phone to read and im so pleasedmy thoughts on the fire hd thesize feels just right to me i read a lot of fanfiction nerdy and i just go to the website in the silk browser tap on the reader mode button and scroll down as i read the device is small enough that i can easily grip it in one hand and use my other hand to lazily scroll down the page as i read its visually beautiful everything looks so clear and vivid during my two days with it so far and the os is simple and easy to navigate ive never had an android device and i wasnt looking to replace my cellphone and this is my first tablet so so far i feel like all the apps ive wanted were in the app store unless youre looking for smaller ones i dont think youll have any issues with the amazon apps i dont know if this is unique to the fire or unique to android but when i plugged the usb in to charge to my computer fire hd immediately told me this was a slow charging port and it would take awhile to charge wow ive never had a device tell me that i switched to a wall outlet and it charged perfectly finea couple of negatives i feel like it picks up fingerprints easier than some of my other devices but theyre easy enough to wipe of and no chromecast support this is actually huge for me because it means i still need my iphone to direct my tv i have a chromecast stick and a roku stick and i generally prefer to use the chromecast since it can also cast from my pc which is nice however when i am in the plex app or the netflix app it only seems to be able to cast to the roku player it does cast to the roku fantastically though so i am happy for that but the no chromecast thing means that this device cannot be a living room hero for me i would have loved to be able to retire my phone to the charger while i was home but it looks like ill still need it to control the tv however i dont think this issue will affect most people but it effects me so i took a staranother thing to note is the speaker location which is on the back of the device instead of the bottom it is true that with certain hand positions youre actually blocking the sound but i actually love the speaker placement when watching a video in landscape if youre holding the device with both hands my hands naturally make a sort of cupping hold around it just my natural handplacement which actually amplies the sound towards mei dont feel like the touch screen is quite as on point as my phone sometimes i need to click something a couple of times to make it do what i want but overall everything is so fluid i got so much more out of this then i expected for such a cheap device,positive
96,this has been one of the best investments i have made for quite a while it does everything my wifes kindle fire does and more plus it wasthe price i couldnt be happier the speed that it operates is much more than my smart phone this is a must have for all you who have been wanting a tablet that does it all without the high pricei have only had it for a week and i am still excited,positive
97,really disappointed initially thought i could live with the quirks because the price was rightmy fire locks up all the time essentially whenever it finishes a download or gets unplugged it has to be completely shut down and restarted to get out of the blank screenfire takes forever to download ordered items as compared to other servicestouch screen tech is sup par what prompted me to write this review was this morning after banging away with my fingerortimes on a link finally saying forget it and going to my lap topit was just then that i realizes that the quirks are bad enough to have me too frustrated to even try using it no matter what the price it was not worth it,negative
98,if you are expectinggig of storage for the kindle fire hdyou will be sad to know there is onlyavailable to user read the fine printvery disappointed with amazon and will not be buying from them again,neutral
99,i love the size i love the feel i hate i can not load google services i live by google apps gooe keep google drive google docs google hang outsi got the fire hd because ive been waiting on atable that could play between my phone and tablet i was prepared to buy aphone to use as a tablet i was excited when amazon release t h e hd i was very disappointed when i found out that the services i use the most couldnt load on a different type of android tablet i can load google services on any apple device but not an amazon tableti understand how amazon wants people in their eco system the problem is that eco system is incomplete without google services samsung has its own eco system and software over lay on android and still allows google servicesamazon is a great place to shop online your tablets and even the fire phone is a great way to give people access to the amazon market place and with amazon prime as a service amazon is growing stronger as a brand each day it doesnt need to block out google services to stand out as a brand,neutral
100,i discovered it is near impossible to delink the kindle fire from my primary amazon account i worry the scenario a criminal gets ahold of my kindle fire and goes on an amazon shopping binge at my expense or my yearold inadvertently goes on an app buying binge already happenedi plan to destroy the kindle fire tomorrowamazon im very disappointedup till now i was a happy amazon user wasted,negative
