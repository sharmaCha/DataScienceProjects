"1",1,23,"I'll preface this by saying that I own an iPad, and was not expecting a $99 tablet to perform at anywhere near that level.  I have followed the early reviews closely, and after seeing enough satisfied customers, I figured I'd give the Kindle Fire HD 6 a try.  I chose the base 8 GB with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e-reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access.  What I've found is a powerful little tablet, so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviews.  In fact, performance has so exceeded expectations that I consider this perhaps the year's best purchase.First off the look is nice. It's sleek, (I ordered the black model) and though actually quite a bit heavier than I'd imagined, it's not heavy enough to be considered a negative.  The display is fantastic, and its quality was the first big surprise. The touch screen performs incredibly well, and to this point, I have experienced immediate response.  To the point where I have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my iPad. Based on early reviews, this was not the case, so I have been quite pleasantly surprised. The Fire is very user friendly and easy to intuit.  For those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device, there is an immediate onscreen tutorial (with an option to skip) to guide you.I first checked out the e-reader function.  My books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and I really like the functionality of the reader.  I am a big fan of the Kindle app for the iPad, and am far more accustomed to its functionality, but the Fire performed  very well and my only complaint is that when searching the definition of a word, Wikipedia is used (versus google on the Kindle for iPad/Phone apps) which is a step down in quality imo, but certainly a small complaint overall, and in the quick 2 or 3 words I searched the answer was attainable from that page and did not require going over to the Wikipedia page as some have reported.Next, I checked out Silk, the web browser.  This aspect of the Fire probably received the most complaints as the early reviews came in.  It was reported to lag and to crash frequently, even on amazon's own site.  I expected this to be the case as I tested it, but I found that these problems must already have been addressed (your tablet loads the newest version of the software upon your registration) in subsequent updates as my experience was the ability to browse quickly and flawlessly across a number of varying websites.  This was the second surprise for me, as I expected a far lower quality and especially a slower speed. I couldn't be happier with what I've experienced so far.I browsed the app store and found it very functional and easy to maneuver, I set up my gmail within a matter of seconds, and I looked through a variety of sales and offers. At no time have I found slow speeds, poor touch responses, or any lagging.The Kindle Fire HD6 has exceeded my expectations in every way, and I still can't believe I got it for $99 + tax.  This thing is an incredible bargain, and so far its quality of performance holds its own against my iPad, something I absolutely did not expect at this price.  I'm sure as I become more familiar with the Fire, the reasons for the price difference between it and the iPad will become more apparent, but when you consider the main reasons for which I purchased the Fire, it holds up marvelously well.  Again, this may be the year's best purchase from a value standpoint.  So far,I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.  Enjoy!UPDATE 1/22/15-  Since writing this review back in October, I've purchased 3 more for my kids.  In perhaps the greatest test of speed and function, namely being easy, fast and fun enough to be preferred by children, these tablets have continued to impress and have proved that they are indeed a game changer in the world of budget tablets. With 3 months of rather heavy use under my belt, I have experienced absolutely no technical difficulties, and I remain a very satisfied customer. I therefore continue to highly recommend this excellent tablet.","joy","positive"
"2",2,45,"If you read my Fire TV review you know that I am tough on Amazon when it comes to their own items. It needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me. Please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions. I will do my best to respond to them as I can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things I discover along the way.First my background. I own many Amazon Kindles (b&w, Fire gen2, Fire gen3) as well as Apple Ipad (gen 4), Samsung Note 3 and have an LG G2 smartphone (had a Samsung S4 before that), notebooks, chromebooks, etc. I have also used many other products including the Fire HDX line. I have a solid computer background as well but honestly I am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one.Amazon has changed many things over the life of the Fire product line. Adding and removing features (like cameras--the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back).They are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you.Now to this model. This is like a big smartphone--which is a big difference from past kindles. It is more compact, lighter and yet still very usable. In fact for me, the shrinking of size increases the usefulness. I find that I use my smartphone way more than my tablets--even the smaller Fire HD and Samsung Note tablets so I am expecting this to replace more of that ""on the couch"" usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones. That means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops. (I am guilty of both.)The screen is very good--certainly not the top of the line but nice even if you factor paying twice the retail for it. It is bright, sharp with the same resolution as pastComparing past Kindle Fires:1st Generation 7 inch--1024 x 600 pixel resolution at 169 ppi2nd Generation 7 inch--1024 x 600 pixel resolution at 169 ppi3rd Generation 7 inch--1280 x 800 resolution at 216 ppi (the first step up in resolution)4th Generation 7 inch--1280 x 800 (216 ppi) (This is the twin to this model and was just released)Whereas this 6 inch model has 1280 x 800 (252 ppi). That makes this display higher or the same resolution than any of the past Kindle Fires with the exception of the more expensive HDX. It makes it sharper with more detail per inch than any of the past Kindle Fires of this smaller size (again except for the HDX). Yet this is the cheapest Fire yet which is quite impressive.Now while Amazon may love my giving this 6 inch fire a 5 star rating, they wouldn't like this next sentence. There is absolutely no reason to even consider the newly released 7 inch fire. $40 more gets you a less ""sharp/detailed"" screen, more weight, more bulk (look at the extra space on the sides next to the screen of the new 6 inch and the new 7 inch) and the only improvements is a second speaker and a larger screen.In my opinion you should consider this 6 inch Fire or consider spending twice as much to step up to the Fire HDX with many improvements (Mayday button, higher resolution, faster processor, dual-band, dual antenna (MIMO) Wi-Fi, and longer battery life). The HDX has some issues with a blue halo around the screen so read reviews of that before jumping.So now that I have talked you out of the Fire 7 and covered some of the reasons for considering the Fire 7 HDX, lets talk more about the Fire 6.Performance/Apps--It is quick (but I am never happy enough, lol), responsive and like Apple products--it just works. Now one plus and minus with all Kindles/Fires are that you can not use any app from Google's app store. That means you have to wait for apps to be brought into Amazon's app store which seems to be slow at getting new releases and new updates. This is really an issue for Amazon and one that still needs to be fixed. The plus to this is that Amazon keeps some of the junky apps out of the system and once they make it to Amazon's app store, they are proven safe and generally work better than the ""fresh"" apps because bugs have been worked out.Amazon's own apps are very well integrated into this and past Fires. They keep improving them and adding features without adding cost. If you have Prime, you get streaming TV and Movies, free ebooks and now Prime Music. If you have Prime, the added free content you get on the Fire makes it a real standout against everything else.I use my Fire 6 for reading emails, surfing the internet, watching videos (some of the time) and playing some games/apps like IMDB. I have found that it meets or exceeds what I have come to expect from these things in terms of performance and reliability. Are there bugs or glitches? Yes but less than my LG smartphone has and less than my Samsung Tab has.Size--about the size of the new ""large"" phones is very nice--not too big but not too small. It is more portable feeling than the 7 inch tablets and it is easy to hold. It is fun to be part of the ""cool club"" without dropping 5-6 times as much or signing a 2 year contract.Quality--Amazon has proven overtime that they can make quality products and this is no exception. At under a hundred dollars there is pretty much nothing else that is this feature packed with this finish quality. I have experienced no quality issues and do not expect anything given Amazon's solid history.Battery Life--So far so good. I was able to stream video and surf the internet for well over 7 hours without any hiccups. From a device this compact with such a large screen that seems quite impressive.Sound--Decent but Apple products are cleaner sounding to me. Volume is usable in most situations but not necessarily in noisy outside situations.I am sure I have forgotten something so please feel free to ask questions. This is my own opinion and while I don't know everything,  I do my best to deliver honest reviews since reviews help me so much when I shop.If you are in the market for a little tablet and have prime, you have to decide between this Fire 6 or the 7 inch HDX for twice the cost. This 6 inch adds the rear camera and most of the performance while being smaller, lighter at half the price.","joy","positive"
"3",3,23,"For the low price, this tablet really does more than expected!  The camera isn't great; however, I always use my phone for a camera so that doesn't effect me.  Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros: Low cost yet high tech  Great screen quality (of course there is better out there, but it looks great as is)  Smooth and responsive  Easy access to amazon prime content  Easy to wirelessly share content to a TV  Battery life  Web browser works greatCons: Doesn't have some apps android users are used to having  Camera quality isn't great and no flash  Less 'extra features' than some higher priced tablets haveI opted to go with the 16gb version with no ads.  The ads aren't a big deal, but I figured I would pass on having them on my screen.  No matter what version you pick, they all do the same things.  The gigs may or may not matter to you.  8 and 16 gigs both aren't very large, but if you want to predownload some tv shows, movies, & music before a vacation, then you may want to look into getting the larger 16gig.  If you will always have internet connection, then it isn't much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet.Overall... If you want an Amazon tablet, and you want the best, go with the HDX series.  However, if you want an amazing tablet but don't want to spend as much, then these new HD 6 & 7 series are great!  For me and my uses, the HD 6 is the perfect fit.I would suggest the 6 over the 7 for most buyers.  The only 2 things the 7 has over the 6, are a larger screen, and dual speakers.  Sure the dual speakers is kind of nice, but the screen is actually lower quality than the 6.  At 216ppi, the 7 keeps the same resolution as it's last (3rd) generation.  The 6, however, has 252ppi which make it's screen a bit more crisp.Here are some of my thoughts:Size: The size is good.  I prefer that it is a smaller size for ease of carrying.  As long as you see well up close, this 6 is a great size!Battery Life: Very sufficient for my needs.  The Kindle HDX's have a little longer battery life; however, this 8 hour spec'd battery life has been lasting a long time, and never getting too low for my uses.Sound: Sound isn't bad.  It is comparable to a laptop from a few years back.  The 6 has only a mono speaker, but it is loud enough and crisp.  I find it is plenty for watching a tv show or movie.  For music I prefer a speaker or headphones(but that goes for pretty much any tablet).Check out my youtube: Earthling1984 for some more information on this tablet.","joy","positive"
"4",4,1,"My 95 father announced, ""I want a Kindle for Christmas.""  No one knows where he got the idea but he actually wanted two:  one for himself and one for me so I wouldn't bother him.  I was skeptical as I like the feel, smell, and warmth of a ""real"" book.  I bought two.  Between Christmas and New Year's day, he read three books.  (Yes, he is a fast reader).  I am working on one very thick (by paper book standards) book and do not have his speed.The purchase was a complete success and I wish I'd gotten them sooner.The photos of my reading father says it all:","joy","neutral"
"5",5,4,"I'm starting off my saying I'm not just anti-kindle.I've owned an original Kindle and a 2nd Gen Kindle Fire HD. I loved them both.  My husband owns one. He loves it. My kids played mine all the time so much they loved them.So, for Christmas we decided to get my older two children their own Kindle Fires. We selected this model due to a tremendous price discount on Cyber Monday.We opened them up at Christmas. And now, my daughter is constantly frustrated. She continues to get a message warning her that storage space is getting low and it shuts the wireless connection down. So, she can't watch the streaming video that is part of Kindle Freetime or even download the little games in FreeTime.So, being the tech family we are (I'm an IT Tech, my husband is a Computer Engineer, so we aren't stupid when it comes to tech devices), we began looking into this.I know that this is the 8GB model. I see that it is advertised as above as having 4.5 of that 8GB available for the user.I call BS on that.  See attached photo.Of the entire 4.5 GB available (according to the above advertising), you get considerably less.Why is Amazon telling me that I get that much space available when their system applications (stuff I can't uninstall, either) take up some of that space and then System files take of 2/3 of a Gig on this one and 3/4 of a Gig on my son's kindle.When I click on System to see what it includes, it says, ""This catergory includes system cache, logs, Text-to-speech files and other system files. I can't see what it is.These people knew how much of their random system files and settings would eat into my storage space.  So don't give me a little sales pitch that I get 4.5 when I don't.So, I did some digging.My husband's 32 GB Kindle Fire HD (2nd Gen) lets us know that 27 GB are available.  Which means the Android OS, the Kindle Fire OS that's on top of the Android system, and all the system files and behind the scenes stuff are planned to take up 5 GB.Which would be about right.  System files, user accounts, system settings, etc. Use up about 1.5 GB of the advertised 4.5 GB of User Storage.  So, Amazon should be honest and say - You get 3GB of storage not 4.5.I'm highly disappointed in this. It's frustrating and disappointing.  My personal recommendation to friends and family will definitely not include this type of Kindle again.","surprise","negative"
"6",6,26,"I was very surprised to find that I absolutely love this little device.  Surprised because I had the very first Fire and the very first Fire HD and ended up giving them to family members because I just didn't like them.  I was hesitant to try the 6 inch since I didn't like the 7 inch and was pleasantly surprised to find that I really, really liked it.  It was easy to set up - email and my Amazon purchases loaded very quickly.  I have the Kindle PW but usually do all of my reading on the IPad mini Kindle app due to the fact that I like the larger screen over the PW.  I only use the PW when I am reading at night in bed if I can't sleep.  That is why I am surprised that reading on the Fire HD 6 is just so nice and appealing.  I like the feel and build of the Fire - it is heavier in the hand than the PW but the heaviness adds to the feeling of quality.  It has a nice solid feel and is very comfortable to hold one handed.  The screen for viewing videos is absolutely beautiful (I think better than the IPad mini).  I bought this mainly to have the text to speech function and it worked very well with the book I was currently reading.  The speaker is not that bad but I almost always use headphones so the mono speaker is no big deal for me.  8GB is not a lot since you really get less than that for your own content but I currently have two episodes of SOA on it, an audio book, one game and five books and I still have just under 3.0GB left to use.  The battery life is pretty good - much better than the previous Fire HD I had tried.  I use the IPod Touch at work mainly to stream the instant videos and my music (never liked reading on it) but with the larger screen on the Fire HD6 my IPod is going to be sitting at home while the mini Fire is going to be my constant companion.  Now on to my complaints - which are very few.  I wish the back of the Fire HD was a little more skid resistant and I really wish the lighting could be turned down to almost black.  For me, at the lowest setting, it is still way too bright to use comfortably in a dark room.  I know there is an app out there to help with this, but the device should be able to accommodate almost zero light itself.  Also, I really wish that Amazon would adopt the ""swipe up and down the screen"" to adjust your light setting.  Kobo was able to do this to their Aura HD with a firmware update and I really wish Amazon would do this too.  A truly immersive reading experience should mean being able to make all your adjustments while still reading without having to stop reading and go thru menus to reach the settings you need (ambient light sensor is still having the device decide what is best and you still need to make adjustments to what you like).  All in all - good job on this one!  It's small enough to go everywhere with you and heavy enough to feel well built.  UPDATE:  I never thought I would ever say this because I always have loved my IPad mini - but I am reading more on this little Fire and my Mini has been sitting in the drawer ever since I unboxed the Fire 6.","joy","neutral"
"7",7,4,"First, let me say that I love Amazon and feel it truly provides a great shopping place for moms.  I buy many items in which I am very happy with through its website and this is perhaps why I am so disappointed with this purchase.  I do not make snap decisions and take time to research an item before buying.  I also rarely spend $100 on any given item.  I bought this tablet because of the marketing done on the product and what the commercials said this tablet was capable of.  I saw the commercial where the tab slid off a car hood and survived hitting the concrete, as well as the commercial where it took a tumble down the stairs, and lastly, the tumble it took in the tumbling mechanism.  My tablet was not so fortunate.  It took a mere 3 ft fall and the screen shattered beyond the point of use.  The commercials lead one to believe it should be able to survive this, but mine did not.  Had I known it was going to be like all the other tablets out there I would have taken better precautions to ensure it didn’t have a chance to break.  I feel that Amazon has wrongly misled its customer’s in its marketing efforts to sale this product.  I have only had the tablet for 3 months and am no longer able to use it.  I called Amazon to voice my concern and was not offered much other than a replacement that cost me almost as much as a brand new device.So be cautious if buying this tablet, it is just like all the others out there!  Buy a case to protect it and treat it as you do your other devices, as it is not indispensable as the commercials claim!","joy","positive"

"9",9,0,"Ordered this for our 8 year old to replace her first generation Kindle Fire. During setup I found out that Amazon has intentionally blocked all casting from the latest 4.5.1 update to Chromecast, not even Netflix will cast with this as it has with our old 2011 kindle fire. It will be on its way back to Amazon shortly.","sadness","negative"
"10",10,11,"Incredible little machine.  Ads on the main pages, but they are NOT bothersome.  Functions totally intuitive-- no learning curve at all.  I hated the Kindle, bought a Nook and Amazon has now done the hardest thing in retail-- they have earned back a customer they lost.  Combine the quality of this product with Prime and their renewed commitment to actually serving the customer and they are unbeatable.  I have an Ipad and this device completely replaced it in 2 hours.  Does everything more reliably and more intuitively.  About the only thing the IPad still wins at is linking with ITunes.  So if you are an ITunes music only person, this might still be a difficult question.  But, this Fire does everything else better than my IPad-- email, video/TV, web browse, reader.  The App war still hinges on Android being twitchy, cheaper, wider and Apple being more reliable, narrow, pricier. But I rarely use apps except games which are fine either way-- if anything they are better organized and easier to get at on the fire if you are a gamer.  Everything is easier to get at here.  Much better device.  Much less expensive.  WAY WAY better customer service.  I rarely leave reviews but Amazon has hit the retail ball out of the park with Prime and Fire.  They are winning again.  Congrats.","anger","neutral"
"11",11,8,"I have had the tablet for a week. I am a member of the Apple (evil) ecosystem, with iPhone 5s, iPad mini, iPad Air, and MacBook Air. While having another tablet is a bit absurd, the Fire HD 6 is much more pocketable than the iPad mini and much less expensive to replace if lost. Therefore, the niche I use it for is to carry it around while out and about, much like my iPhone (with its most direct competitor being the iPhone 6 plus), but with a screen just big enough to read comfortably.(I might use it as my alarm clock, since the clock has an excellent night stand view.)Since I am not a member of the Google/Android (evil) ecosystem, inability to use those apps/music is irrelevant to me. If anything, I would want the Fire to be more like a cheaper, smaller iPad. I would like my Apple news/magazine subscriptions to be fully usable with Fire apps. My National Geographic subscription works fine on the Fire, as does my NYT digital subscription, but the Fire NYT app is more limited than the Apple one. However, there is enough common apps/interoperability (e.g., Outlook Exchange, OneNote) not to mind leaving the Apple realm and entering the Amazon dominion.The build quality of the tablet seems solid (though thinner/lighter would be nicer), and battery life and screen quality are excellent. The accuracy and fluidity of the touch screen are comparable with an iPad. The tablet seems quick, but sometimes lags, but so do my iPads. I have not found the software to be buggy. Most steps and features are fairly consistent with other tablets and therefore are not hard to learn. Amazon should consider adding a May Day option that users could purchase if they are new to tablets.This tablet is best for something that's easy to pocket, but big enough to read. Many could use it comfortably as a primary tablet, but a higher end Amazon tablet would better fill that role. The size of the Fire HD 6 also seems to eliminate many reasons for having a Kindle device, except for reading in the sun or next to a light-sensitive bed mate.","joy","neutral"
"12",12,-1,"I bought this for my son 10 year old for Christmas. He loved it, everything was great. The sound, the speed, the clarity awesome. It had all the games and books and music.

He did not throw it down it slipped.  I called amazon to see if there was something that could be done, it was only 4 months old. NOPE! I was told a dropping the device voided the warranty.  There is no repair kit, or vendor. But she could offer me a discount... of 113. a SIX dollar discount from the current price. I bought it for $99 so not really a discount for me.

"13",13,10,"i love this tablet.  i am a tablet geek -- don't know how i got to that place because i went into tech kicking and screaming.  I own/have owned 1st Nook and all subsequent Nooks, kindle paperwhite, kindle fire, kindle hd, hd 8.9, hdx 7, all Samsung Galaxy Tablets including the Note 8, original 10.1, currently the 2014 10.1, the Note 2 and currently the Note 3 phones, an Ipad 2, and 2 ipad 3/with retina, and the original Nexus.  perhaps others have escaped my memory.That said, the primary tablets i currently use with any regularity are my Note 3 phone, my Kindle Fire hdx 7, and my Note 10.1 2014.  I will be adding the Kindle Fire 6 to the list.  it surprised me with the size.  i'd excpected a more square device, but it is about the size/shape of an average paperback -- and not a trade version.  I don't get everyones comments on the back of any device -- i think most people but some kind of case or cover on their devices, so who cares.  I have a $30 Fire HD 6 case on my device.  the whole thing is about 1/2"" thick.  I don't care about the camera since i use my Note 3 as my camera.  i don't skype (or even FaceTime on the ipad). I mostly use my devices as ereaders and sometimes for games (mostly use my large phone).  I also use them for web surfing, email, and the occasional YouTube playing.Why do i like this?  the screen is great -- and i probably won't put a screen protector on this as I have with all other devices. The speed is fast.  I received a notice on my HDX 7 that an upgrade will be coming soon.  What I hope to use this particular device for is serious reading -- non-fiction religious books, writing books, 12-step literature,  and the like.Finally, for those who don't like Amazon's ecosystem, all devices are locked into an ecosystem.  However, there is a way to get some other apps onto the Kindle.  Go to www.getjar.com. From that site you can download other, non-amazon apps.  the one i've downloaded onto all of my kindles is the Nook app.  yes, i can use a Nook app on my Kindles.  since Nook was my first e-reader, i have perhaps 1000 books on it.  I still occasionally purchase Nook books, especially if they are part of a series i started on Nook.  Nook also has a Nook Daily Find, which is an inexpensive title priced low for that day.  and they have Free Fridays, where a book, an app, and now a video (often an episode of a TV show) are available for free.I hope this helps.

"16",16,0,"Warning if you have a limited data plan. This device should only be used if you have unlimited or lots of data as it constantly transfers large amounts of data without notification even if you never stream video or music.  The first day we fired this up it used over 3Gb of data just updating and installing free junk we did not request or want.  We paid extra not to get the ads  and I would imagine that they constantly update and use even more data.  I have owned every  Kindle since the original  one and loved them all  but this one greatly disappointed me.  We are rural and data is expensive but this device seems to assume that everyone has unlimited data.  There does not seem to be anyway to limit it's data consumption so every time you enable wireless you will have no control over how much data it uses.The touch screen seems far worse than the original Fire requiring several taps to select things.  My wife downloaded an audible book and when she tried to open it the second time the screen did not respond so she tapped it twice which then deleted the book with no notice. Very poor design and not nearly as well done as the original Fire that we each use for hours every day.I spent my engineering career designing computers and I regard this as a device that should not have been released until the bugs were worked out.  Before you sell a product the software should be updated and not require a huge update right after power up.We bought this for the size and Bluetooth streaming but may have to return it if there is no way to fix the data consumption.","sadness","neutral"

He didn’t put it down even though it, as yet, has no case and he is used to reading kindles like a book—open and close.My joy was finding all my music there, all my books, and emails etc. Who cares about the camera? My husband is a professional and loves his various Nikons he won’t use anything else.  I care for those quick shots to capture the deer nibbling at my shrubs, the dog doing something adorable; the children caught in fun. “I thought you were reading.”  I am reading. No fabulous shots, but it’s in my kindle.I haven’t given it the full workout, but I will before we deregister them and give them to worthy schoolchildren.But they are so light and so reasonable, I am thinking of buying one for my handbag… commuting, airplanes, doctors and dentists offices with their interminable waits, coffee shops…  and keeping my earlier joy, the original Kindle HD at bedside and syncing.Based on this two- day experience, I won’t buy stock in Amazon.

Just make sure you have the 16GB version as the 8GB version ultimately has only about 3.5GB free storage making it essentially a cloud device. Also when downloading videos I suggest choose the ""Better"" downloading format which is the middle choice between lower and higher resolution (and storage). I find this to be perfectly acceptable from a viwing standpoint.Overall the screen resoloution and sharpness is better than I expected. I agree that this can also serve as a terrific e-reader and if you do not have an iPad, a fun device to play games on. I find the touchscreen not to always be perfectly responsive but am guessing this can be fixed by a software update.Fantastic value overall.","surprise","positive"
"19",19,2,"I bought them for my boys. It's a perfect size for them. They keep them on the charger while at school, and can play them until time for bed. It's not my first time getting a kindle fire, but first for my boys. The quality is great! And they are having a blast using them!","anger","positive"
"20",20,14,"I have a Kindle Fire 8.9"" 1st generation and I love it. I didn't need the HD 6"" (8G) tablet but I wanted something smaller and I love this size. The price is so fantastic, $99 for a tablet is such a deal.I wasn't sure how I would like reading on a smaller device but I actually like it better, even better than my Kindle ereader.I was pleasantly surprised to find that this little tablet really is much faster than my larger one. And it seems to use less battery power. I got lots of free apps and loaded it up with books, music,and photos. This didn't slow it down. Music does take up more storage than anything else.I had no trouble downloading books, audiobooks, music, and pictures. The tablet is very easy to navigate despite the smaller size, I don't even need a stylus.This is my fourth Kindle product. I bought the 1st and 3rd generation ereaders and the 8.9"" tablet and they just keep making them better. I have never had any issues other than a couple charging issues when the 8.9"" first came out but it was fixed quickly.The 6"" streams very quickly, no glitches and looks fantastic. It is faster than my laptop and larger tablet. It's amazing!I do wish there was a flash for the camera, especially since it is both front and rear facing, I would use it more. This is the only con I have found.This is another great Amazon product that comes with all the extra features they offer their customers.I used to think people were crazy for reading on their phones but this isn't much bigger than some and I could read on this all day. It truly is a steal.Update 10/9/14; I am still LOVING this Kindle, I use this more then my ereader or 8.9"" Fire. I pretty much use it all the time!Don't get the Battery Saver app, it would sometimes make the tablet freeze.I also like that on this Fire I can have my reading background be a light green color. I was using sepia on the other Fire. This may not be new to the HD Fires but it is new to me and I like it.","joy","positive"

"22",22,3,"I bought this tablet for my 8 year old son. This past year I have spent 70.00 on a cheap RCA tablet, and 100.00 on a google nextbook, then 160 on the Hisense Pro last year for Christmas. Needless to say, ALL OF THEM HAVE BROKE SINCE THEN!For being under a 100 dollars I can't praise it enough in comparison to the other tablets in that price bracket. Compared to the cheap tables I bought before, this tablet is glorious.Since I bought it for my son, I really appreciate the sturdy structure, very easy to hold and use for small hands. But it also fits VERY comfortably in my own hands. Its actually easier to hold than my own tablet, the fire HDX 7 (the sleek back, and pointy corners make my hands cramp up. I think I dropped it five times on my face before I got the case which makes it a lot easier to hold!)The picture looks fantastic for the price range. Very clear and bright, no glare. If you've bought cheap tablets before, then you know how terrible the glare can be. The sound is decent. The touch is super easy and sensitive. My son has no problems navigating through Pocket Minecraft. Added Kindle Unlimited Freetime for kids and I am in love.I have had no problems with any lagging or crashes or even when I've stole it to surf on the internet.I made the mistake of buying my 7 year old and 4 year old Leappad 2s last year and greatly regret the money trap that comes with it. (games loaded directly onto the Leappad range anywhere from 7.99 to 25.00 per game!!) If your in the market for buying a tablet for your children, you cannot beat this nugget with the free time. Cheaper, full of games, books, kids movies that personally have my two younger kids drooling over my son's new tablet.I'm waiting for the kids case to come out and it will be perfect.On a different note, I have thought about buying one for myself just to fit easily into my purse for easy reading when traveling.I hope the price stays the same because I will be buying these for Christmas gifts for pretty much all my nieces and nephews!","joy","positive"
"23",23,5,"I love this tablet. So far it does everything I need it to do. This is my first tablet and I'm quite happy about it. I was using the 3rd gen kindle. It's nice that it's the same size as it. The only drawback is that it's hard to hold it up because it's heavy. I recommend the 16GB over the 8GB. I think spending the extra 20 dollars for more space was worth it. Also it was nice that your Amazon account came preloaded and all my books were ready to go for me as soon as I took it out of the box.","joy","positive"
"24",24,11,"Love love love. Coming from an Apple fan, owner of two previous kindles and the loving owner of an ipad mini. It's extremely fast compared to the original kindle fire and just really fast in general. Recommended for anyone, but don't think it replaces an ipad if anything it's a great sidekick! And I do want to note how much this product has made me love Amazon more, and it's great for teens because Amazon was the first ever online shopping I ever did and the first time I could learn to buy things for myself, it rewarding to wait for your products and unwrap them, esp when you are 14 and never had much of your own privilege of buying gifts for your family on your own.","joy","positive"
"25",25,14,"I got mine yesterday and I can't stop playing with it.  I have a number of tablets and it's my third Kindle Fire but it's my first 6"" tablet.  That is it's outstanding feature.  It's a perfect fit in my hand when playing Sudoku or other light games, which are most of the games I play.  This is going to be my first choice for little games from now on.I've watched a couple of TV shows on it.  I'm used to watching on a larger tablet but they're fine on this.  When I start watching my first thought is that I'm not going to like this small screen and the next thing I know I'm absorbed in the story and the screen is world-sized, just like my larger screens when I'm watching a TV show or movie.  It's easy to carry walking around the house while watching a show and I like that.I listened to a few minutes of an audiobook and that works out nicely.  The speaker is fine for that in my quiet house.  It's good and clear and has enough volume.There have been a few little problems.  When I type in a search phrase, either in the browser or in the store, about half the time when I'm a few letters into the description the keyboard disappears.  I've found that if I wait for whatever page I'm on to finish loading that doesn't happen.  I'm hoping this will be fixed soon in an update.  In the meantime it's a pretty minor problem.  I've had a lot more and worse problems with IOS 8 on my Ipad and with Windows 8.Another problem is that when I adjust the brightness for reading it adjusts for the tablet overall, so I have to adjust at the beginning and the end of each reading session.  This needs to be fixed and it needs to allow lower brightness than it does.  It also needs to allow more color options while reading.  The sepia reduces contrast too much.  The background is improved but the text is now not dark enough.  Allowing us to control the text and the background separately would be much better.  As it is I probably won't use it for reading.  I have a Paperwhite so that's okay but I'd like to have been able to do more reading with this thing too.Other than that it's been very good.  I wonder if this will start a new size trend among tablets.  I won't be surprised if it does.Barry","joy","positive"
"26",26,34,"http://youtu.be/0zqGgBe1bPo (Unboxing video of the kindle, simple and short)This is an amazing tablet!  I ""Upgraded: from the original fire HD to this mini tablet!  Why? Well first the original fire HD was getting outdated and a lot of apps I needed wouldn't work on it.  Apps like Dish Anywhere did not work on the old fire HD.  Newer apps didn't work well or at all on the older fire OS..  With that being said, I wanted to update to fire OS 4!!  Fire OS 4 is a big big improvement from previous fire OS systems.  New fire customers do need to keep in mind that even though fire OS is based on Android, there is no google play.  You have to use the amazon app store But i have never had any problems with that.  With the new fire os my dish network app works now!! The app store now has more apps and newer apps..  The kindle works better with new amazon technology's such as second screen.. Second screen did work on the original fire HD, it came as an update, but it was very sluggish.  Now with the new kindle it is fluid and works like it is supposed to.Another reason I purchased this tablet was bc of its size.  This tablet will fit in your back pocket or cargo pants very easily!!  I know I could have got another 7 inch tablet but for me the 6 inch is the perfect size!!  I got into kindles originally because of their size.  I dont use my tablet as a computer so I don't want a big 9 or 10 inch tablet..  This 6 inch is actually my favorite size for a media device!I big plus is that Amazon now includes the charger block again with their tablets!  All for $99!!  My original fire HD I had to purchase a $20 charger block.. The block that comes with the smaller kindle 6 inch is smaller which I like..This tablet has a much more powerful processor than the original fire HD.  It has two extra cores and the difference is VERY VERY noticeable!  The 4 core processor is great for multitasking!If you use services like ""Prime Music"", ""Prime Instant Video"", or any other amazon service, these tablets are a must!! They work much better than android or apple tablets using these services..  Fire tablets also run apps like netflix fine so if you don't use prime, netflix will work great!!The quality of this tablet is amazing!! Have you ever felt the cheap tablets at best buy?  If so, you know they feel and look like crap!! This tablet feels and looks like a $200 - $300 tablet!! Very durable and seems to be very very well built!! They took time designing the tablet, and that can be seen.. One example is the camera, lots of phones and tablets put the lens flat with the back of the phone or tablet.  The kindle lens is slightly lower than the back of the tablet!! Why is this important?  If you lay your tablet flat, this keeps the lens from scratching.Lastly, I cant stress enough that if you plan to purchase this tablet thinking it is an android tablet ready to use google play and other android services you might be disappointed!  But please don't purchase this tablet to leave it a bad review for something ""its not"".. because it's not an android google tablet.  Its a kindle fire HD and its amazing once you get used to it :-)Special offers dont bother me PLUS i have found some great deals and trials through the special offers!!  I recommend not paying the extra to turn off offers, but that is just my opinionEDIT:  After my first day using the tablet I can confirm it is a very big and welcomed upgrade over the original kindle fire HD.  The screen looks MUCH better (Yes, it is the same resolution but the smaller screen makes it clearer).Another function I have been really enjoying is the built in bluetooth.  I have been playing prime music on the tablet all day over my bluetooth speakers!!  The original fire HD also had bluetooth BUT the bluetooth on this new kindle seems to work much much better!","joy","positive"
"27",27,6,"I may have been spoiled by hubby's Nexus devices. While only sporting 7"" screens, they make the most of the real estate and have fabulous visuals and specs to boot. Sadly, the Fire HD6 fails to meet my lofty expectations. From the start, it feels thicker, clunkier and heavier (though it is lighter!) than the larger Nexus 7. The screen almost looks to be set further into the device. It's resolution is 1280 x 800 (252ppi), which is a far cry from the 1920 x 1200 (323ppi) I'm used to. For a stand alone reader that would be fine. When a major selling point is full access to Amazon Prime features like the HD VOD service, that isn't so fine. More on that later. Both sport Corning Gorilla Glass, both have front and rear cameras, both have quad-core processors,wi-fi, bluetooth and access to a wide array of apps. So, since one is more expensive than the other, you'd be inclined to forgive the screen issues and focus on what Amazon got right. Right?What amazon got right was the price. Sold for as low as $84 recently, you'd be hard-pressed to find a quad-core device of equal build quality for less. And with 1GB of RAM, it should handle light mobile games, email and some light web browsing with aplomb. But when you get to the software, that's where things go off the rails for me. Amazon skinned over the lovely Android OS with their own proprietary features, much to the detriment of the user experience. Perhaps it's because I'm used to a pure Android experience, but the devices seems seriously hamstrung by the Fire OS. You lose access to the Google Play store, you lose access to a synced Chrome (and all it's bookmarks with no way to import them), you lose access to the device synchronicity you're accustomed to, and you're forced into an ecosystem that is geared towards Amazon consumption at the cost of being truly user friendly. I found myself constantly frustrated by trying to do what I've been doing with my Android devices for years now, only have to try to learn Amazon's way of doing it instead. Yuck. What's worse is when you get into heavy web browsing, downloading, or typing, you get so much lag you want to fling the thing into the nearest wall. All the ports are at the top of the device, the single rear speaker is absolutely awful, and the camera, at 2MP, is positively anemic. Though it does sport an HDR mode and a wide array of editing tools, the pictures will never be anything to write home about, especially in low light conditions. The screen size is frustrating for me tapping and touching with normal sized fingers, and Hubby couldn't do squat with his much bigger Hubby paws. Amazon does sport it's own app store, but more than a few of the versions of the apps available, while seemingly identical to their Google App and Apple App Store cousins, are usually a few versions behind. Because, let's face it, there are two big dogs on the app block, and it doesn't make sense to spend a bundle on development for the two little dogs with very little market penetration, Amazon and Windows. Amazon has also locked the bootloader, which means no third party development is available, which is another huge upside for normal Android devices, and a hinderance for Kindles.I like having access to my Amazon Prime benefits. I like being able to stream my free video and audio benefits seamlessly. I like the Kindle features that go above and beyond the Kindle apps available for all my other devices. I like that it is small enough to drop in my purse and not know it's there. It seems to be very sturdily built with unobtrusive buttons that don't get hit accidentally. And I like the price. Aside from that, there is also plenty to make me say that I doubt I'd buy a Kindle on my own any time soon. The proprietary, frustrating nature of the OS. The ads on the lock screen. The focus on the ""Amazon experience"" and not the customer experience. The lack of synchronicity. The screen. And some personal experience. The memory on my first device was corrupted, and the charging port was borked. Amazon sent a replacement next-day air. But after several rounds with their ""customer service"" chat to figure out how to connect the device to my TV for a true HD video experience (6 different chats got me 6 different failed methods), I eventually gave up and resigned myself to a 6"" sub-HD screen for the foreseeable future. I also don't know how I only have 3.5 GB of space on a 8GB device when it arrives. Too small to download a movie, and very little space for apps, media, or really, anything. I've used Samsung Galaxy Devices, LG devices, Asus devices, and Nexus devices. Kindle is dead last in my user experience.I wanted to like my Kindle. I wanted one for some time. Amazon shot for the moon with their Kindle devices and instead, for me, shot themselves in the foot. Perhaps I expected too much. If it's for youngsters, you have a relatively well built, relatively inexpensive device that they can stream the occasional video, play a few games, and read a few books. For a grown up, you're better off buying a grown up device. I received the above product(s) free of charge from Third Voice Marketing.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.","joy","neutral"

"30",30,-3,"This tablet is terrible.  I ordered it for the conveniently portable size, and my sister-in-law loves her Fire HDX.  However, this little brother did not live up to expectations at all.  First of all, although the HD 6 started out working fast, downloading and running apps with no problems, after just a few minutes of use, it began to bog down and lag behind.  While reading a digital publication, I tried to scroll down to continue reading the page I was on and it started to lag behind.  It would not stay with my finger and the page began to move erratically.  Then, the text blurred and the screen got stuck in between 2 pages.  After several seconds, it finally caught up but was almost totally unresponsive to my touch.  I tried removing the apps I had downloaded and reinstalling them to see if that was the problem.  It worked perfectly for a few minutes again, but then went right back to being slow and glitch-y again.  I'm returning it today.","joy","neutral"
"31",31,3,"Very happy with it so far. I've read, surfed the web, watched TV programs, listened to music, and taken a few pictures.

I will update this review at a later date if I run into problems.","joy","positive"
"32",32,5,"I seriously do not understand the one star reviews. If you read the product description, which is very through, you will understand that this tablet is Amazon-centric. $99 for the ability to do immersion reading (listening to audio books while the kindle book reader highlights the words), have access to Prime video and music (xray for prime video is amazing), do some web browsing, shop Amazon, and play a few games; what is there to gripe about. The tablet runs very smoothly, has a very easy to use interface and lasts me a whole day before needing to be recharged. I also love the case. It has magnets that actually keep the flap in place in both the closed and open position. The little crease in the cover allows the tablet to sit in portrait or landscape. I can't imagine a better value for an entertainment / media consumption device. If you want serious gaming or have major productivity needs then buy a Tab S or an iPad, both of which cost four times the price or more. In case you can not tell by now, I am very smitten with my 6"" fire HD.","joy","positive"
"33",33,6,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son. This was the perfect purchase!  It is small enough for him to carry around, yet big enough for me to ""borrow"" at times.  It even allows him to download a movie to watch in the car, where there is no access to WiFi.  I LOVE the parental control and FreeTime features.  I can require him to read books for a given period of time, i.e. 30 minutes, before he is able to watch movies or play games.  I can also set it to shut down at a particular time on weekdays, and set a separate time for weekends.  There are more than enough books, games, and apps for him to enjoy!","joy","positive"
"34",34,11,"Okay, I will admit it. I have always been a Kindle skeptic. I would consider myself pretty experienced with tablets, but they have always been on the android platform. I have heard mixed reviews about this particular tablet, but let me tell you, I was beyond impressed. I never thought a little six inch tablet would pack this much punch.This does have a good weight to it, which I like. I opened this up and the setup process took less than 5 minutes. It synced effortlessly to my amazon account and I can now watch movies, look at photos, and read my books with no issues. I have experienced zero lag, even after installing about a dozen apps. The layout is a little different than other tablets, but it was very easy to figure out. Everything loads very fast. I think one of my favorite features is that it imports my photos to the cloud (but has unlimited photo storage for pictures) so I can access all of my photos from all of my devices! It is great to have them all in one place.Obviously, this opens books like a dream. The camera is pretty good for a tablet. My phone has a better camera, but I do not expect very high quality photos from a tablet. This blew my expectations out of the water!I definitely recommend! I received this product for review purposes.","joy","positive"
"35",35,14,"For a tablet at such an excellent price, ($99 compared to a whopping $500 for my iPad) I am beyond impressed with my new Kindle Fire HD 6. The HD looks pretty great (I watched some Netflix on it and wow!), the App Store is very intuitive, and I even enjoy reading books on it more than on my iPad. I was expecting it to be lighter than it is for such a small tablet however it is not uncomfortable to hold even for long periods of time.I was unsure about purchasing this with special offers but I'm very glad I saved the extra $20 and got it with the special offers since they do not bother me. The ads are only on the lock screen and home screen and does not affect reading or use of applications. I think it is perfect for reading books and enjoying some fun applications as well. I would definitely recommend this and think it's a fantastic gift for a more than reasonable price. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.","joy","positive"
"36",36,14,"I love this new generation of Fire HD! I've had Kinde 2nd generation and an iPad mini. I sold iPad mini and kept Kindle, now this Fire HD will replace my old Kindle. Now, many people who give this device 1 star reviews are upset about not being able to use Google Play store. I am a very light app user, meaning I only have about 3-4 games I play and two apps for videos. My Fire tablet has exactly same apps I have on my Android phone, Amazon app store completely satisfies my needs. Why is this in my opinion better than iPad? And at the same time worse? Because I use tablet only for watching tv shows on Netflix and reading books. Having $500 iPad just for that is a shame. This tablet has a great screen, very responsive, video quality is amazing!!! Books..omg I love Amazon library..everything is so cheap, and as a prime member I get one book of my choice for free once a month. Super happy. If you want to use your tablet for way more than that - like do some work on it, some heavy web browsing or gaming - you probably need to get a regular Android tablet, because this is not. This is kindle fire, made for watching videos and reading books primarily, for having excess to huge music, ebook and video Amazon library , thats its main purpose... Know what to expect when you order it, so you don't get disappointed. I personally love it very much. This great new size is perfect for just throwing it in the handbag and taking it with you everywhere, just like you take your phone ..I highly recommend this tablet for everyone who feels this tablet is enough for them. I know its definitely enough for me!","joy","positive"
"37",37,-1,"Well to start off this was a decent little tablet that I had bought for my wife.  The reason I am writing this review today is that I had the unfortunate experience of having seen the Kindle Fire HD drop test commercial on TV.  Apparently it can fall off of a car and still work.  Unfortunately with the one I bought that was not the case.  My wife dropped it from a distance of about 2 ft off the ground and it landed flat on its back on a linoleum floor in the Amazon brand origami case.  When she picked it up the screen was not cracked at all but there were lines and screen discoloration.  I email Amazon customer service and they said that they would replace it, but then I got a second email that stated they needed more information.  So I used voice chat with a customer service representative and explained again what happened and that yes it had been dropped.  Due to it being dropped they would not replace it, which I understood, so I asked if they could repair it or give me a better price on one and send this one in so it could be refurbished.  They said they do not repair them.  So then I asked how much could you take off if I sent this broken one in so you could fix it and resell it as refurbished.  I believe they quoted me at $127, which seemed to be not such a fair deal.  So I just said no thanks and bought my wife a Galaxy Tab 4 7 inch.  I know that the old Galaxy Tab 1 that I had was made with Gorilla Glass, the Fire HD 6 certainly is not as strong as the first generation Galaxy Tab.  As a matter of fact when you push on the screen you can feel it indent or give, but with the Galaxy Tab there is no give.  I had even dropped the Galaxy Tab on its corner unprotected and it still worked, but left a ding cosmetically.  Maybe the short fall breaking the HD 6 has something to do with the tablets weight, for its size it feels like a little brick and is quite heavy.  Again the only reason I'm reviewing this now is that I saw the drop test commercial and thought, Oh really, just don't assume that you will get a replacement when it does fall as advertised.","sadness","neutral"
"38",38,4,"First of all, let me talk about the price. Amazon is trying to compete with companies like Apple and Samsung for a spot in the tablet world, and Amazon found their competitor's weak point-the price! The last time I checked, you cannot buy an iPad for under $100, nor can you purchase a Samsung Note for that price either. Although the HD 6 does not have the full range of capabilities that the other tablets have, it is still an amazing piece for the price. One thing that I did not like was the fact that I cannot change the wallpaper. Having used Apple devices all of my life, that has been common for me, and even though it is kind of a small thing, it still might matter to some people.THE GOOD--amazing price-size is perfect for ""on the go"" people-Amazon customer service is very helpful if you need help operating the tablet-makes a great gift for anyoneTHE BAD--Although the Amazon music store is good, the app store is limited-The headphone jack must be flawed because it sounds staticy when I plug it inWARNINGS--Do not be fooled by ""special offers."" When you buy the tablet for the base price of $99, it automatically comes with this feature called special offers. This gives Amazon the right to put ads on your lockscreen. Although the ads do not interfere with the rest of the tablet's features, the lockscreen ads can be cumbersome occasionally. YOU CAN OPT OUT of the special offers for $15 more.-Also, go with the 16 G model, because the 8 G model only comes with 4.5 Gigs of storage available to the user.","joy","neutral"
"39",39,8,"I've used the regular kindle, both original, fire, and fire hd.  Never liked the fires.  Thought they were too heavy and they didn't quite fit in my hand  comfortably.  And being a diehard bibilophile, I much prefer paper copy.  But I'm seriously considering one of these.Pros:smaller size doesn't make a noticeable difference, surprisingly.  the picture is very clear, which helps.  there are a few apps that are just too small to use well, but most do fine.Super lightweight compared to Kindle fires.  Light enough to keep in my purse all the time without getting scholiosis.I thought the touch screen was more responsive than kindles, which sometimes balk at my touch.The sides have this funny angling that makes it extremely easy to hold.  Fits perfectly in my open hand without making my fingers cramp. (I have a 8 1/2"" hand span from pinkie to thumb if that helps give you an idea of my hand size)battery life seems to be about the same as kindle hd, but of course will depend on your use and settings.Wi Fi pick up is fine in my house, even thru the brick wall to the addition.NEAT NEW FEATURE:  in the settings you can change the type font size from small med or large.  This is not the font size for books or the internet , but the fonts for the actual kindle, the settings , tabs and so forth.The 'carousel' is still there, but if you actually select books, they are arranged in either list or grid format, with choice of au, ti, or recent.  Still no option for grouping by folders :(Also, when you go to home, what you see are your most commonly used apps and some preloaded things like the camera arranged on one screen.  Swipe down to find the carousel.volume control buttons on one side as with an ipadyour most used apps on on the home page,  and at least some of the apps can run in the background (like pandora) while you use another app.CONsOk, it is smaller, but still much bigger than most phone screens.The camera still shot quality is only acceptable--2x mag, the attached flower photo was taken outside in full sun at arms length.  It's a very peach toned flower, by the way.If there is a manual to tell how to use the camera features, I haven't been able to find it yet.No power light to show when it's charging or done charging (this is probably the biggest disadvantage)and the screen reflectivity is still horrible in bright light.  Using the camera in full sun is pretty much taking 'shots in the dark'.  You won't know what you got until you go back inside.Summary:  I give it 4 stars for bad camera and lack of charging light.  Otherwise, if you want a cheap tablet for internet access and apps, and emergency reading, I think this is really good.  All the cool colors are great too.","joy","neutral"

I logged into my home Wi-Fi network and downloaded and installed apps that I already had from previous ownership of a 2nd generation Fire HD and my current Fire HDX.  I'll be holding onto the HDX, but I wanted the 6 primarily because of it's smaller size.  My intention was to just read books I've purchased through Logos and Olive Tree, but I went ahead and set up my email accounts just to see how this inexpensive version handled things.  I've had no problem setting up Gmail and iCloud email accounts and was able to set up my work email as well.So far the only real problem is with Olive Tree, which crashes every time I try to download purchased books.  I've asked for help from both Amazon and Olive Tree on this and will post here if I find a solution.  All other apps have worked without incident.  I opted for the 16Gb version, but I'm still only loading certain apps such as:  Instapaper, Evernote, LinkedIn, NOAA Weather, 12C Financial Calculator, Microsoft's OneDrive, Adobe Reader, and Calculator Pro all installed without a hitch.  The built-in Calendar and Contact Apps synced up without any problem as well.I've downloaded a couple of books and downloaded and tested an audiobook as well.  The speaker isn't on a par with the HDX's, but I didn't expect them to be and am pleased they're as good as they are.  I tested a couple of songs as well - no problem with all my music in the cloud being on hand - and they sounded as good as the audiobook.As I indicated at the beginning, I didn't buy this as a replacement for my Fire HDX, iPad or iPad Mini, but because I was attracted to the smaller form factor for purposes of reading books available through Android apps as well as my email first thing in the morning before I get out of bed.  The things that surprised me are that the battery life actually seems better than it's elder siblings and that the responsiveness is just as fast as my other tablets.  I've spent more than time with this device than I will under normal circumstances because of all the setup, downloading and testing and I have 30% left on the battery meter after several hours of use.I also ordered the cover Amazon designed for this Kindle.  It, like other Amazon covers, works well and costs more than I'd like.Even though I haven't been able to download my Olive Tree books (yet) I'm still giving the Fire HD 6 a rating of five stars.  At this price I'm very impressed . . . and very pleased.UPDATE - After the first couple of weeks, here are some additional observations:  *  Camera - focus is fine, detail is what you'd expect for a lower pixel camera.  Saturation and contrast are washed out compared to an iPhone5, but I didn't buy the HD 6 for its camera.  For the price, the average user should be more than happy.  If you're really picky about pictures, get a DSLR.  *  Battery life - continues to outpace the HDX 7, which makes sense because the HD 6 isn't using as much processing power as the HDX.  *  Apps - Regarding the problem I mentioned above, both Amazon and the folks at Olive Tree were responsive on offering assistance with the Olive Tree Bible Study app crashing.  In less than two weeks, Olive Tree updated the app and the problem was solved.  *  Responsiveness - I take back my comment about responsiveness being as fast as other tablets.  It's not bad, but there's the occasional lag in refreshing the home screen.  Again, for the price it doesn't bother me.  *  Storage - I opted for the 16 Gb version because I wanted to download commentaries in the Logos and Olive Tree apps and have them available when there was no Wi-Fi.  I'm glad I got the larger capacity or I'd be pushing the limit.  If you're primarily going to use the tablet when Wi-Fi is available you could probably rely on the cloud and go with 8 Gb - otherwise break that three figure barrier and spend the extra twenty bucks.  *  Size - I'm 6'2"" and have fairly large hands, but the small size isn't a problem and for people with smaller hands I imagine the HD 6 will be a pleasure.  I compared the screen size on the HD 6 to that of an HDX 7 and HDX 8.9 when surfing the web.  Of course there's a difference, but it wasn't as dramatic from a usability standpoint as I thought it would be, especially when using Silk's ""reading view"".Three weeks in and I'm more than satisfied with this Fire, especially from a portability and cost standpoint.","joy","neutral"
"42",42,8,"First, let me say, I'm a self-confessed gadget junkie. I own a myriad of electronics (computers, tablets, ereaders, mp3 players), but I've never owned a Kindle Fire device. Until now. I work quite a bit so usually pocket my iPhone, iTouch and sometimes my iPad MiniR when leaving for the day. I've always been attracted to the compact gadgets based on by lifestyle as hefting a heavy tablet or computer is never easy on the back.When I heard about the Fire HD 6, I was intrigued enough to follow reviews in different forums for the past few days and hunt for any reviews of it on Youtube. I decided to bite and picked one up at my local Best Buy store this morning. Ordered online for in-store pickup and had it unboxed and running in less than an hour. It synced all my books, music and apps that I had previous bought when I owned an Android phone. Logged into my Netflix and Hulu Plus accounts and tried out an episdoe to see how it would play. There was absolutely no buffering and the sound quality was great. I know some have said it doesn't compare to the other Fire tablets, but I found it meets, and even exceeds my needs. I've only begun playing with this little device, but I know already it has become one of my favorites and will be coming with me wherever I go. Looking forward to the holidays and picking up a few of these for family members as the device will be a wonderful gift.","joy","positive"
"43",43,1,"Finally! Kindle text to speech that fits in your pocket. I may need to get a life at some point but until then, I can listen to tech books and NIST Special Publications during my 1.5-2 hour daily commute (this will now take the place of my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9""). I've managed to get through some pretty hefty certification books including Shon Harris' excellent CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide 1430 page tome cover to cover 3 times during my commute.The only 'wish list' items I have would be:- add a 1.25 reading speed (or change the control to a slider to broaden the range of values since 1.5 can be too fast for dense legal or technical content. I use ezPDF Reader Pro for the slightly faster reading speed when listening to PDF files),- ignore pictures, lines and symbols that might cause the TTS to freeze or to misidentify the item such as 'currency' for a poorly selected bullet item symbol or read 'underscore underscore underscore underscore...' for a header or footer line.- allow the disabling of acronym and abbreviation assumptions such as DR as doctor, 'g' as grams, etc. ('dee-arrh' and 'gee' would let the reader apply the correct context). It does make for interesting reading when doctor is substituted for ever instance of disaster recovery...I'm totally thrilled with the new, smaller form factor.","joy","neutral"

"47",47,20,"I was sooo, so excited upon hearing about the new Kindle releases. $99? Who can beat that? Especially for a great brand. Budget tablets and ereaders exist, but I was never willing to sacrifice a better brand with better service even for the cheaper price. Basically all I wanted a tablet for was to read on. I'm a librarian and frequently use our eBooks database, as well as NetGalley, and Kindle books. I've been thinking about a Kindle Fire for ages, but never wanted to shell out the money for it just to read on. While the paperwhites are inexpensive, they have limited features and I like that I can go into my Goodreads app, as well as Facebook, and web browse. It's very helpful for me when searching for new books to read, and reviewing.As I am not looking to do any heavy duty web work, blogging, emailing, video watching, music listening, etc on here, those functions are nice if I ever would need them, but I can't talk about their functionality because right now I don't intend to use it.If you are looking for an inexpensive Kindle that is in a tablet form, not the paperwhite, this is absolutely perfect. There are a few issues with being able to download my books that are not from Kindle, but after a couple of web searches I was able to figure it out. If you are a dedicated reader that uses several platforms, this is worth checking into. It is a way better deal than shelling out $350 for an iPad Mini if you're only intending to read on it.I'm thinking about having our library purchase several of these to have on hand because they are so affordable and nice for readers! I just can't get over how perfect this little tablet will be for reading on, especially when traveling!","joy","positive"
"48",48,16,"So far so good. I have had my Fire HD 6 tablet for about 2 weeks now, and so far I love it! In my opinion it is the perfect size. Its big enough to watch movies and surf the web but small enough to easily toss in your backpack, purse, or even your back pocket! It is a little thicker and heavier compared to other small tablets. Some might think of this as an advantage and others as a disadvantage. I personally think its an advantage. If it was any thinner, it would feel very fragile. The screen image quality is amazing. Everything looks crisp and vibrant. The speed of the tablet is decent. It is very snappy when switching apps and browsing the web. When I watch Amazon prime videos, it loads almost instantly without buffering. The app selection isn't as large as other android tablets that use the Google Play store or Apples app store. But there is still a large number of apps that you can download. It's definitely larger than Microsoft's app store. I have owned Ipads, an Ipad mini, Galaxy tablets, a Microsoft surface, laptops, notebooks, and all kinds of smartphones. This Fire Tablet is by far my favorite device. Mainly because it was only $100. Most of my other devices cost $500 or more and weren't a whole lot nicer or faster. I'm not saying this Fire Tablet is the best tablet out there, but it is definitely the best tablet out there for $100.In summary, here are my Pros and Cons...Pros:PRICE!!!decent speedgreat graphicsportabilitydecent sounddurabilityAmazon Prime integrationChoice of multiple colorsUnlimited cloud storage for picturesCons:thicker and heavierapp selectioncant customize wallpaperssimple (maybe even boring) designBuy this tablet, you wont regret it! If you do, you can always return it :)P.S. For those who are debating buying the tablet without the special promotions, I recommend not doing so. Get the cheaper one because most likely you wont even notice them after a while. If in the future you really don't like the promotions, you can always log into your amazon account and pay an extra $15 to disable the promotions.","joy","neutral"

It's notably smaller than the Fire 1s and 2s, which isn't necessarily a good thing, and the software is generally awkward. I expect it's about to take a trip back, being it won't start now, and it's only a few days old.1/16/15: The replacement is even worse than the first, and it won't even turn on now that it's hit the internet.

Not even a ""let's get started"" pamphlet like they included with the Roku I bought.  Amazon wants you to BUY the instruction guide (come on, guys!!), or rely on what's available on the Kindle itself. If you never owned a tablet before, and are not sure of how to navigate, this is frustrating.  I will figure it all out eventually, but for now am having to rely on advice from other Kindle buyers online. Or maybe I will break down and shell out more $ for the instruction manual eventually.

"55",55,-2,"I loved mine. I really did. But, it had one serious flaw- the stand-by battery drain. Every time I turned it on, the battery had lost 2-15 %. Nothing I did helped-powering off, removing special offers, turning the brightness down, turning off notifications, keeping it in airplane mode except to download a book, deleting all my apps, even re- registering etc. I had planned to call customer service this week, but one night the battery had 29% left and the next morning it was dead.  I had only managed to read about 50 % of my book. So, I de- registered it and returned it to the Amazon kiosk at the mall.

I think that is probably acceptable. I agree with the people who think it is too heavy for its size. I wish the app could tell me the hours/ minutes of actual use, not just the percentage of life remaining. At least one of the screensavers is too dark to see the keypad where you type in the pass code, with brightness at 50 %. And I would like to turn off the sleep/ wake feature.","disgust","neutral"

"59",59,22,"I've been sitting trying figure out why I like this thing so much better than my hdx7.  It isn't as thin.  The screen isn't as...well perfect. It feels quite a bit heavier.  I've been at a loss for a while now; but I think maybe another reviewer said it best.This thing feels great in your hand. It feels substantial, but not too heavy. The screen is good enough so that when you use it, you never think about the screen...well unless you're thinking something like, ""I can't believe I got this screen for a hundred bucks!""  In a lot of ways it reminds me of a paperback novel.I loved those things by the way.  More to the point, I love reading because of those things. I propose we all start thinking of this model kindle as the paperback novel of kindles.  It is a more portable, more affordable variation on the original.  In just the same way the paperback novel was for the common person, so too is the hd6.  It is a good tablet, with good performance, a good screen, and decent battery life...and oh by the way it is one most people can afford.  And I will say something else, which is, I'm not sure any other hardware company could build a tablet this good and sell it at this price.  I think Amazon's hardware designers are just that good.As someone who cares for value, and who has done a good bit of research on so called ""value"" tablets, let me save you some time.  There are no other value tablets.  Not this good.  Not nearly this good. This tablet makes all other ""value"" tablets look like a foolish waist of money.Plus it does things even my Nexus 7 could never do, like fit comfortably in my pocket.I bought this device with every intention of trying it out for a week, just so I could understand it a bit better.

I wanted to buy my 12 year old daughter a tablet for her birthday and really vacillated as to what to buy.  If you go too cheap, all you get is an outmoded, slow, and clunky piece of crap that won't hold up over time.  If you go the way of the basic iPad mini, you're giving a kid $250 piece of technology to knock around in their backpack.  When the Fire HD 6 went on sale for $79 during Cyberweek the timing couldn't have been better and I went for it.  I haven't had this thing for a long time, granted, but I've seen plenty of tablets in my day and for a kid--and even an adult--this thing rocks.  This may not be the latest and greatest technology, but you would be hard pressed to find a tablet this refined and with this good of a user experience at a similar price point.LONG REVIEWFirst and foremost, when you buy the Kindle Fire HD 6, you are getting a sweet piece of well thought out technology.  The thing arrived in exactly 2 days from purchase and was mailed in the nondescript cardboard packaging that Amazon usually uses for medium sized books.  Inside was a simple cardboard container that Amazon uses for their frustration-free packaging.  But when I opened the frustration-free package I was more than surprised to see that they hadn't skimped on the presentation.  The box for the Kindle HD 6 has an Apple-worthy, simplistic beauty.  You shouldn't judge a book by the cover, but the look of a gift is incredibly important and the quality of the packaging absolutely reflects the attitude of the manufacturer towards the product.  Amazon hadn't skimped here and my daughter's eyes lit up when she looked at the box.INSIDE THE BOXInside the box, you will find the carefully packaged Kindle itself,  a micro-USB charge cord, and quick start card.  The device itself is machined well, without any dogeared edges or superficial flaws.  The device is made of plastic, but it feels solid in your hands.  Unlike most low-end electronics, the on-off button and the volume buttons also have a firm, feel.  The charge/sync cord easily fits into the Kindle's micro-USB port.  There is no jiggling and no difficulty placing the cord.  In the past, I have bought lower end electronics with cheap USB ports that don't quite fit or easily break--this does not seem to be the case here.SET UPOnce you turn on the device, the tablet walks you through setting up your local Wi-Fi and you enter your Amazon account information.  Once done, all your content on Amazon is available to you (all kinds of media and apps).  You can then decide how you want to set up the device.Fire OS is not standard Android, but anyone who is used to technology the learning curve is easy.  I did have to consult the Amazon website for a few particular things, but basically once you set the device up you will be 99% set to go.  The user interface is elegant and a great skin on Android.  The limiting factor, of course, is that you are stuck with the Amazon app store.  This is rather robust at this point, but still lacks the sheer number and diversity of programs that you can find on Google Play.  Nevertheless, the Kindle Fire series gives you  unprecedented ease in accessing all of your Amazon content.  Additionally, this tablet is no toy.  It can do anything a run-of-the-mill Android tablet can do.Setting up a kids account with appropriate restrictions is a little more complicated, but well worth it.  I'm all for giving children major leeway, but having the web at your fingertips with no restrictions on a device that can be used in private is a little too much responsibility.  The fact is, that the kids accounts can be configured to give them incredible leeway but you can also restrict total amount of use time, restrict the apps they can use, and the ratings of the media that they can view.  For a parent, this is a godsend.  There is lots of help on the tablet itself when you set up a kid's account and there is additional information on the web.THE SCREENI don't know why anyone would complain about the screen. No, this is not the retina display of the latest iPad Mini 3.  But at 252 ppi it beats the basic iPad Mini (which is at 163 ppi) and comes incredibly close the the latest iPad Air's 264 ppi.  Given the 6 inch screen, 252 ppi is quite an incredible amount of resolution.  Even small text comes out as crisp and unpixilated.  The rendering of color, the brightness, and the viewing angles are incredible for a device that would cost twice this much, let alone at this price point.  Is the screen as good as the one on the basic iPad Mini?  It sure seems so to my eyes.  Maybe it's the smaller form factor, but there is no real compromise here.  The screen is incredibly responsive to gestures.  So far, there is little or no lag.  The tablet has yet to freeze or stagger.  I realize I have not been using it for more than a couple of days, but I haven't seen a better screen on anything in the sub-$200 category.  Kudos to Amazon for this.Rendering of movies and complex games was far better than I ever expected.  This is a media consumption device, after all, and it does this incredibly well.  As an old guy, I would like a bigger screen.  But for the iPod/smartphone generation, watching media on the small screen is second nature.  Ditto on web surfing and eBooks.  The screen will render web pages full size with type that is readable for me only because I wear progressive lenses.  With appropriate eyewear, however, web surfing is a pleasant enough experience.  I would prefer reading my eBooks using a larger form factor, but they are serviceable on the device.  At age 12, my daughter isn't bothered in the least.  That said, with a 6 inch screen, this tablet is not much larger than most phablets out there, so if I were getting a tablet for myself I would have opted for a larger form factor.USER EXPERIENCEIn reading professional reviews of the tablet before purchasing, a lot of ink was spilled regarding the wimpiness of the HD 6's MediaTek MT8135 1.2/1.5 GHz processor and paltry 1 GB of RAM.  The first observation I would make is that it is ridiculous to expect that a tablet in this price range will purr and hum like the top-of-the-line Galaxy tab or suped-up iPad.  Sure, the HD 6 may suffer in comparison on some benchmarks.  It's still a $99 tablet, not $200 to $400 tablet.  Still,  in my hands, so far, the performance has been more than snappy.  There is very little lag (I think I have more lag on my iPhone 5S for some tasks.Raw hardware is absolutely an important consideration but it is meaningless unless there is a good marriage between hardware and software.  Amazon has optimized the experience for those who are interested in Amazon content and have really done this brilliantly.  It may well be that the higher-line Kindles do their stuff even better, but even if that is the case, the experience with the Kindle HD 6 is still great.  I will have to see how things go as the tablet gets filled up with apps or there is some serious multitasking going on .  But so far, so good.IMPORTANT ISSUES/TRADE OFFSWhat are the downsides here?  Well, at $99 there had to be some compromises. At 2 megapixels, the rear camera is serviceable but by no means perfect.  I agree with most of the reviews I read previously: the camera takes too long to focus and low-light pictures are definitely blurry.Weighing in at 10.1 ounces, the HD 6 is something of a brick by modern standards.  The larger HDX 7 is only 0.6 ounces heavier and has a larger screen and longer battery life.  Clearly, the lower end components simply weight more.Battery life is slated at only 8 hours.  I haven't tried this in real life yet, but most companies overestimate battery life.  To keep costs down, Amazon had to make some decisions and clearly they opted for an older, heavier, lower-end battery to achieve this.  Still, 8 hours at full tilt would have been pretty amazing battery life a few short years ago, so it's still not too bad.The HD 6 only has a mono speaker.  Audio on these kinds of devices can never be truly high end (there's no way to get a full-range speaker on something this small).  The sound, though, is fine for a speaker of this size, but it's clearly a compromise.Single band Wi-Fi.  Clearly, this will slow down the web, but I didn't notice this at all using Amazon's Silk browser.  No issues with download times, but that all depends on your network.Low memory: on the 8 GB model, after accounting for the OS and basic apps, this apparently leaves only about 5 GB of memory are left over for content and additional apps.  1 GB can store about 250 songs or 614 photos (at ~1.5 MB per photo)--not bad.  But it takes about 2 GB to store a movie.  So if you don't install any apps, you could possibly store 2 movies on your 8 GB HD 6.  Not great.  And, sadly, there's no micro-SD card slot for memory expansion.Then again, the purpose of this device is really streaming.  You are allowed to cache movies for later viewing, but the Kindle is really meant to stream content, not act as a repository for it.  You could opt for the 16 GB HD 6, but that'll cost you $20.  (After buying the tablet, though, I think buying the extra memory is well worth the cost of the upgrade.)Given cost constraints, Amazon has left out some common features seen on mid-range and higher end Android devices.  There is no GPS, no NFC (near field communication, for close proximity near-touch transfer of data with other devices), no haptic feedback (that 'buzz' you feel when you type into the keyboard), and no ambient light sensor (allows for automatic adjustment of screen brightness, among other things).  None of these missing items is a deal breaker for me at this price point.  I think the trade offs were reasonable to keep the low price point (e.g. I'd rather have the better screen than the NFC, haptic feedback, etc.)  GPS would have been a nice touch, but it is less useful without 3G/4G LTE service, which is not an option on this product.Fire OS 4: this is both a pro and a con for this device.  On the one hand, Fire OS is optimized to provide a great Amazon-content experience.  There is a great marriage of hardware and software here.  On the other hand, Fire OS 4 is less customizable and less user configurable than stock Android.  It's not that Amazon hasn't added value here, but in adding an excellent Amazon experience, you are stuck with choices that you may not have wanted to make.  The interface is elegant and, I believe, enjoyable to use, but it's locked down and some users--especially those who like to tinker a lot with their interface--will not appreciate this fact.CONCLUSION:I was far more impressed with the Kindle HD 6 than I could have imagined.  It is a low-cost product that really delivers on a high end experience.  It is certainly not a high-end tablet, but Amazon packed a lot of value into the product.  You get a lot more tablet than you purchased.  If you are looking for a device for one of your children and you don't want to sacrifice an arm and a leg to the technology gods, this one's for you. If you are looking for a great holiday gift for someone who is entrenched in the Amazon universe or are looking for an entry-level Kindle, this just might be the one.  This is by no means a high-end tablet, but it is insanely good for the price.","joy","positive"
"61",61,11,"I had the 2012 Kindle Fire HD 7 inch and I loved it. When I saw that there was a new, cheaper, PINK Fire HD coming out, I had to get one.I've been playing with it for awhile now and I love it even more than my old Fire. First, it's pink. The screen is very responsive (like the old one), everything works quickly (like the old one), and it has TWO cameras (unlike the old one). The front camera is basically the same quality as the camera on my 2012. However, the rear camera (which was absent on the 2012) seems pretty high quality. It takes nice, clear photos. Also, my old apps work fine on this Kindle.Also, I love the feel of this one. It fits well in the hand. It has a nice heft to it that tells you it's not cheap junk, but it's not so heavy that it's going to wear out your hand.Overall, I have no complaints. I figured that I wouldn't, being such a devoted Fire tablet follower. I don't think you can go wrong with anything in the Kindle lineup.**UPDATE**After a full day of playing with it, I still have no plans to downgrade my review to four stars. However, I will say that I have now noticed a few of the quirks others were complaining about. First off, I HAVE discovered a few apps that won't play on this Kindle. Fortunately, all the major ones work. Also, the battery life is a little shorter than my original Kindle Fire HD.  Speed and responsiveness are barely, if at all, inferior to original HD. Volume is lower, but you have to remember that the smaller size necessitates one less speaker.That might seem like I found a lot of problems, but the ""problems"" are extremely minor. Plus, the tablet costs $100 ($119 if you got the 16gb like I did)! Considering the tiny size and price tag, these small flaws are perfectly acceptable in my opinion.  Love it!","joy","neutral"
"62",62,9,"What an incredible sub $100 tablet! I saw that these were available as a preorder, had a bit over $100 in gift cards burning a hole in my account and my daughter had been hinting that she would like a new tablet. I seriously considered the 7"" for a little more, but after thinking about her usage habits and the way she does what she does online, I went with the 6"", and a day after it arrived discovered I had hit a homerun.She loves the tablet, she loves the size, and she loves the color (Citron). She had a tablet before, a fairly awful piece of equipment that cost as much as this less than a year ago and was so bad that she never bothered using it much, she has had the FireHD 6 with her since it arrived.The specs are good, but don't really tell the whole story, if that was the case then the noname Chinese Tablet I bought her last year would have been great, it wasn't. This tablet has good specs, and more importantly works well, everything she does it just breezes through, no lag, no hanging up or other undesirable behavior. The battery life is great (much much better than the Chinese tablet with a battery rated at a similar capacity).In the end I was hesitant to go with this tablet, the specs were good but not impressive, lots of Chinese tablets have similar specs at a similar price. The Size had me really concerned, I just assumed that the smaller size was more of a cost cutting method to get the price under $100, I was dead wrong, this tablet is handy and works well, that means that it gets used a lot, which in the end is the true measurement of value, and this one stands tall.","joy","negative"
"63",63,-2,"I purchased the 16 gigabyte version on sale for 89 dollars without ""special offers"". The 8 Gig version was 69 on sale without ""special offers"" What made it something I couldn't pass up... was the offer of a payment plan which I agreed to, and so I made the purchase, Having charged me the 89 dollars, the email they sent me now said I had bought the 8gb version. I tried to cancel the purchase. They said I could not. I was indeed sent an 8 gig version which I could have gotten for 69. Realizing they had just ripped me off for 20 bucks,  I proceeded to dispute the sale and recover the thing I had actually bought (a 16 Gig version) at the price I'd bought it, (89) and in the way I'd bought it, (on the payment plan). After days of explaining and arguing with mental deficients with a certain almost laughably greedy bent, I at least got what I had paid for. It wasn't easy by any means, and I through some amazing zeal to take from me anything they could....they did take away the payment deal and have charged me, all at once. I should mention that they also took a bit of my sanity also. That seemed to be the plan. Explaining the obvious over and over and over again to those who barely listen and comprehend less, is NOT fun.  New Egg will be getting more of my business whenever possible. A part of me now hates Amazon. They took alot of my time, a large part of a good deal from me, and lost a friend. You suck Amazon, and I'm a Prime member.","joy","neutral"

I am forever having to delete what little I can from the stupid thing so that they can use them. It also kicks you off of wifi any time the storage warning comes on.I currently have a kindle that I love, but these little tablets are very disappointing.

"65",65,-2,"Up until now I have been a confirmed Kindle Junkie. I loved my Kindle Fire. But right out of the box, this one was slow (it takes between 30 and 50 seconds every time to load my library and the carousel), the back arrow button takes me out of the book not to the last location and it just now froze while I was trying to shut it down to see if that would fix the problems. Each of the last three Kindles I've purchased, the Paperwhite (gave it away), a regular Kindle (sitting in a cabinet) and this one, have just gotten worse. I don't know if this is an isolated incident or an indication of the future, but I think this is my 8th Kindle (several of them were warranty replacements) in 3 years, I'm not going to continue spending money on these readers that don't last very long even when they are working correctly.

"67",67,21,"My Fire hd 6 arrived this afternoon so I have just begun to test it.I'll update this review tomorrow after I have put its features through a bit more of a trial. But so far I'm delighted.I have a bit of experience with computers, Kindles, and Android tablets, so this is not, I hope, an uninformed review.First off, the tablet arrived in perfect condition, beautifully packaged. It was a joy to unbox and a cinch to set up. I plugged it into an outlet and watched as it automatically booted up for the first time. No problem. Neither was there any problem connecting to my existing Amazon account and gmail account. The system update took a while to download and install. And it took even longer to get the battery charged up fully (in part because I decided to use the tablet while it was charging.The tablet itself is a solid, well made slab. It feels like something that is not fragile and that will last. It's comfortable to hold in one hand with squared edges that don't jab into one's fingers the way the edges of my thinner Asus Memo Pad 10 tend to do. It is not a featherweight, but rather it weights exactly the advertised 10.1 ounces (the same as the venerable Kindle 2 it will largely replace).I purchased it primarily as an ereader and have tested that function. I rarely read in direct sunlight but often read in bed so the backlit screen is perfect for me. The text is very sharp and the entire Kindle reading experience is a joy. Text to speech in public domain books uses a pleasant female robo-voice. I'm quite happy with it. I haven't yet tried Audible books or audio books from my public library, but I'm quite certain they will work (after I fiddle around to install the Overdrive app). The single speaker is loud enough for most purposes.The Silk browser is fast and smooth. I'm using it to write this review and am very pleased with the implementation of the swipe keyboard for writing. Word prediction is accurate; the action is smooth. Web pages come up as quickly as they would on any of my laptop machines--maybe even a little more quickly.Amazon Prime videos load and play smoothly. The six inch screen is quite big enough for pleasant viewing, given that I wanted a light weight device I could easily skip in a coat pocket or a back pocket.I took a few test photos with the camera. It works, but it is only two megapixels. Still, I have found my two megapixel cell phone camera capable of taking surprisingly good macro photographs of wildflowers and insects. My initial results with this tablet's camera were a bit disappointing. But I have hopes of figuring out how to take better shots and will report back tomorrow.To be continued . . .I have updated and expanded this review on my blog page. (Google search for ""Lake Norfork Adventures"". Note the spelling of ""Norfork"" or else you won't find the page.) That review includes some tips for side-loading apps, but I devote most of my attention to the camera. I do a bit of macro nature photography to help in identifying wild flowers and insects. I've posted a few photos taken with this camera. It is surprisingly useful!","joy","positive"
"68",68,14,"Summary:  The games that you (or who you are giving this device to) probably won’t work on this device.  This includes Minion Rush, Angry Birds (Ad-Free), DoofenDash, Clash of Clans and many other big hits!  DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE UNLESS YOU DON’T PLAY GAMES!!!I purchased 2 Kindle Fire HD 6 tablets as gifts for my boys for Christmas 2014.  Upon receiving them, I decided to get them all setup prior to wrapping so the kids can jump right in and use them after they are unwrapped.Upon getting them connected to my WIFI and registered on Amazon, I found that of the list of 20 games I was going to install on it, only 4 of them could be found in the Amazon App store from the device.  That didn’t sound right to me, so I searched for the apps in the web version of the Amazon App store from my pc.  Sure enough, the games are there, but it shows a little red ‘X’ next to my Kindle Fire HD 6 tablets in the compatibility section.  We are not just talking about a couple of no name games here, but large grossing games of the era are not compatible with this device.My next thought was that maybe I am doing something wrong here.  I am a geek by nature, have owned a few tablets in my time (iPad 1, iPad Mini, SG Tab 2) and I have android phones & 2 Amazon Kindle e-readers, so I was wondering that if I couldn't figure it out, how would someone without as much geek experience do it?Next, I got on the phone with Amazon Kindle Support.  Don’t get ahead of me.  Those of you who may have been on the phone with support may know where I am going.  During my 64 minutes 31 seconds on the phone, I spoke with five people, two of whom were managers, across two different departments.  Every time that I was transferred to someone new, the phone connection got quieter until person four… I couldn't even make out what they were saying.Here are the resolutions that I was giving by the support reps:- Person 1 (Kindle Support) – let’s get you to the app store support line to see if they have any clues (ok, maybe we can get somewhere here)- Person 2 (App Store Support) – well, if the game won’t install, just pick a different game and be done with it. (did not sit very well with me, mind you!)- Person 3 (App Store Support Manager) – well, it’s the app developers fault that they haven’t updated their games.  Why don’t you return the two 6 inch tablets and buy 7 inch tablets because the apps should work on those. Oh Wait, their all back ordered (“Yes, the gas doesn't work in this Chevy, go buy a Cadillac and it should work fine” --- again, not happy here)- Person 4 (Kindle Support again) – I couldn't understand her between the phone issues as well as her accent.  Rule #1 of customer service… support should help, not frustrate!- Person 5 (Kindle Support Manager) – The apps aren't compatible because of the Kindle Fire operating system that recently was released.  We are working to resolve the issue, but we do not have an ETA as to when the update will be available.Each person that I spoke with, I had to re-explain the problem all over again.  I refuse to accept the fact that a company the size of Amazon doesn’t have their house in order, but I guess I am wrong.  I am sitting on two Kindle Fire HD 6 tablets, which each have two games on them and running out of time for Christmas.Don’t make the same mistake that I did.  I thought that these would be simple and great tablets for my kids.  I WAS WRONG.  Heading back to what I know works and will NEVER buy another Amazon tablet again.","joy","neutral"
"69",69,8,"SlimPort...my reason to buy!  I still own the three previous Kindle Fires in 7"". Generation II  had HDMI out but whatever showed on the device appeared on the screen.  With SlimPort, only the media shows on the TV and IMDb info and other info like running time and battery status, etc. remains on the device.  Only Amazon content shows full screen however.  Netflix, HBOgo, and Hulu+ do not. Settings on whatever you use as a monitor can usually take care of that but for some, it's a hassle.  Amazon content was what I was mainly interested however...download overnight in HD and watch the next day without the interference associated MirrorCast or Second Screen.  Nothing beats downloading and a cable if your Wi-Fi isn't always stable.Enough people are giving the pros and cons of the Fire HD 6.  I love this little guy.  Got the 16GB (11.6 GB usable) version and wish it had more but I have enough Fires for games and such.  This lil' guy is strictly for video so it suits me just fine.  I'm a happy camper!SlimPort also works great with Amazon MP3's.  If you want to save space on the device, just download you music to a flash drive and using the proper adapter (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C452XFO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) or similar, you can play your favorites with no Wi-Fi necessary.  Amazon content will even display lyrics if originally available.  No need to use onboard storage.  This is good stuff!","joy","positive"
"70",70,16,"I love this thing! This wasn't bought for my daughter, or an elderly family member.I bought this for me and portability. For those that don't like the fact that the kindles don't offer TTS (text to speech) bam! It's here! Quickly hooks up to Bluetooth in the car. Easy to keep in my pocket, and with the affordable price not worrying about it getting beat up. It's tough well built and never plan on buying a case for it.To be honest I also bought it to feel what a new iPhone 6+ would feel like.Some gripes: Yes the camera isn't great but it's good enough. I do wish they would make taking pictures easier, like holding down the volume button or having it available from the start screen. Also I have a KDX and the icon for camera actually looks like a lens and not a brake rotor.Until today Hulu wasn't available, kudos! Now I need the WSJ application to work.So to wrap it up, nice portable on the go fire that isn't just for kids.","joy","positive"
"71",71,3,"Not a happy customer: Side-loading apps removes functionality. The Fire OS is inferior to Android OS in terms of usability. Furthermore, I am inhibited from using my google ecosystem on the Fire OS.Worst of all, the Kindle is pretty much a window into the shopping world of amazon, and I am constantly reminded that I need to buy things rather than being able to use the tablet simply for work purposes. I do not recommend","joy","positive"
"72",72,8,"The sheer value of this device cannot be understated. I got the 120$ 16GB model, and it doesn't feel like a single penny wasted.The 6 inch screen is a bit small, but wider than most phones of the same height and better suited for browsing, reading and viewing media. The clarity and colors in the screen are simply amazing for the price, any other device at 120$ would be lucky to look half as good.The device feels a bit thicker than it maybe should be, but as a result feels solid in your hand, almost like a real paperback book. I feel like if I dropped it, it wouldn't break immediately.Sometimes the software hiccups a bit, but I haven't noticed any significant slowdown. It runs most games just fine.The battery does what it promises, and lives about 8 hours of use.Again, for 120$, or just 99$ for the 8GB model, this can't be beat.","surprise","positive"
"73",73,1,"Bought for my toddler to watch Netflix/Youtube on trips and outings. The price was phemomenal and I had it in mind to purchase a second for myself. Much to my chagrin, this product is unacceptable for any adult with expectations of a good/great operating system.  Sturdy device, solid weight but not too heavy. My largest complaint is that It's more useful as a ""remote control"" for Amazon shopping more than anything else. There is no Google Play store, just copies of Apps that you would commonly find. The Freetime App for kids is more annoying and obtrusive-- what is the point of a kid's app that isnt intuitive for children who can not yet read? And the bargain basement versions of apps crash more frequently than cellphone and other tablet versions. It's stylish, has some interesting features (email docs directly to the Fire) but in my opinion, too much of the OS is devoted to continued shopping on Amazon (even when you pay 15 add'l dollars to turn the screensaver adds off)","anger","neutral"
"74",74,15,"For a first tablet, this works perfectly for me.I purchased this for one reason: to be able to read e-books in bed where it's warm. I have not been fond of reading stuff on the screen of my PC, so I wasn't all that certain the Fire would work for me; but it works wonderfully. I have already spent hours reading on it (I have had the Fire for about two weeks). The fact that I can also watch NBA games on this device, and the picture is HD clear, is a fabulous bit of icing on my cake.The camera seems to work just fine (I discovered the selfie view--holy cats, when did my nose get this big?). I can transfer photos to my PC easily (not the nose one). I had forgotten about the video-taking capacity and today was horrified to discover that I'd recorded a 60-second video when I first got the Fire, which was the quintessential ""old person with new technology"" show, including frighteningly clear mumbled narration. So that works. The deletion function works really well, too.For people who are technologically adept, yeah, I can't tell you what you want to know about this device.  But, even considering how low my expectations were for any e-book reader, I am exceedingly delighted with my new toy.","joy","positive"
"75",75,6,"I purchased this small kindle fire as a supplemental e-reader for when I was too lazy to use my surface 2. However, after playing with this adorable little tablet I am pleasantly surprised at just how capable it is!While the device looks a little chunky, the weight feels appropriate in the hand and is distributed evenly across the device. The screen, while only 6 inches across, is absolutely stunning for watching movies. The user-interface is what you can expect from Amazon's proprietary forked android software~ but unlike previous iterations of the Kindle Fire the transitions seem much smoother and all-around ""zippier.""The speaker on this tablet is not the best, nor is it the worst. If I had to draw a comparison~ it is probably on-par with many high-end tablets from 2012 that were quadruple the price. Appstore selection is ""okay"" and you still have the option of side-loading android apk's onto the device if the appstore doesn't have them.For the price you pay, you are getting a hard-working bundle of fun that literally fits into your pocket.

"77",77,18,"I cannot tell you how much I love the Kindle Fire HD 6""! The clarity of the screen is extremely impressive for as small as it is. That part surpassed all my expectations. It has convenient volume buttons on the side and from what I can tell, the speaker quality is pretty good for something so tiny. It fits perfectly in my purse so I can take it anywhere with me and it is on the light side, so it doesn't weigh my bag down.My all time favorite feature on this is the Goodreads button! I have been saying for a few years now how much easier it would be if eReaders synced right up to Goodreads and it finally happened. Instead of logging onto Goodreads to update my progress or to add a new book to my currently reading shelf, all I have to do is tap the screen, hit the Goodreads button, and I can update everything from there. It even tells me about how long it takes the average reader to read the book I'm currently on. Maybe it's the book nerd in me, but I was so excited about that feature that I literally shouted out loud in excitement when I saw it.Another feature that spoke to the bibliophile in me was the related books feature. As you are on the home screen, scrolling through books, it will show you a few other books you may be interested in purchasing based on the subject of that book. I received this in exchange for an honest review and my 100% honest opinion is that compared to the original Kindle Fire with the 7 inch screen that I already had, this is by far my favorite one. I highly recommend it. If you are mainly using it for reading, you will get over it's small size rather quickly when you see the amazing features and incredible screen quality.","joy","positive"
"78",78,16,"This has quickly become my favorite tablet. I own every version of the Kindle line-up from the original Kindle Fire, right up to the HDX 8.9 and HDX 7 inch. I also have an Ipad 2 and an Ipad Mini, both of which are gathering dust because I prefer to use the Kindle HDX 8.9, which is lighter, faster, and easier to transfer files directly from my PC. I did not expect the HD 6 to be as good as it is, but now I can’t do without it. It is easy to hold and transport, and fits nicely into a small bag. The screen clarity is excellent, wifi is faster than previous versions, and the sound is much better than I expected. In fact, I think music sounds better on the HD 6 than the HDX 7, which by the way is the only Amazon tablet I have regretted buying. I should have returned the HDX, because the blue haze around the edges made the device virtually unusable. Comparing the HD 6 and the HDX 7, I would say the HD 6 is far better in quality, and less than half the price of the HDX, at least when I bought the HDX last year. Moreover, the HD 6 has both rear and front cameras, and while I don’t use them much, I find the picture capability suits my limited purposes, such as scanning receipts and other documents. Battery life is comparable with previous versions, not better or worse.One other point is worth making, since I haven’t heard other reviewers comment on it. Text on the HD 6 is remarkably readable. Before I bought the Fire, I feared that text would too small to read on a 6 inch screen. But the software upgrades have made a huge difference. Reading newspapers and magazines on the Fire is a real pleasure. The text size automatically adjusts to the screen, so that if you enlarge text you can read everything in one screen, rather than seeing portions of a line as before. The same thing is true with documents, especially if you use the WPS Office on the Fire. I can read my Word documents just as easily on a 6 inch screen as on the 8.9 one.I am very happy with the Fire HD 6. The HDX 8.9 is still the king of Amazon’s tablets, and it has replaced my laptop when I travel. The Fire HD 6 is a close second. Don’t hesitate to buy it. You won’t be disappointed, and you will be surprised how quickly it will become your preferred device.","joy","positive"
"79",79,12,"Good for travel and consuming Amazon content. I wanted this small Fire for when I fly and want to watch TV or movies. Most of the content provided by the airlines is old or low quality. Since I have a prime account I can choose from a fair selection to load for free.  I was pleasantly surprised that even the ""good"" mode gives a pretty clear picture.  I tested it with the pilot episode of the Sopranos - it's a good picture, took just below 400mb.  I got the 16GB fire so I can easily fit 20 similar episodes which would cover any domestic trip including airport stops.  One warning, video has an expiry date which for the Sopranos was three days.Overall performance was good.  I was impressed by the email app that came with it, I found and set up my office email no problem. It's not thin and light, rather heavy.  Not for carrying around with you in a pocket for long times. It's a limited android, the apps available without rooting or side loading are not extensive. Youtube worked well.  The biggest weakness is that it doesn't have Google apps or Google docs. The app store is small. I'd recommend it if 1) you are a Prime member and 2) you want it mainly to consume Amazon content and 3) you don't need Google apps.Best part it is cool to be able to download for free so many videos and prime music, keeping in touch with email, and the office-type suite apps you can buy to view office docs. I got Mobisystems Office Suite 7 pro and when a co-worker sent me a word doc attachment to my email it opened easily.  Also basic photo apps and of course books are there. I use Apple devices normally so it did take a day to get used to using the Android style interface.It automatically loaded my kindle books no problem.  Wifi connectivity worked well.I would actually rate this 4 and a half stars with half a star off for missing a broad range of Android apps especially Google apps.","joy","neutral"

I had to continuously restart it by pressing the power button. I noticed that the problem got worse if I was hand holding it. If it was laying on a flat surface it would still shut off on its own but not as frequently.I did the 40 second restart. I did it 4 times and the problem continued. I chatted with a customer service person at the Amazon site. While she was very nice/helpful, the problem continued. Basically, my Kindle Fire 6 HD is almost impossible to use as I can't view anything for more than 15 seconds without it going black, then switching to the ""recommended ads screen"". I tried disabling this feature thinking it might help, but the problem continues.I purchased an off-brand, Android based inexpensive tablet for my kid and it works perfectly compared to my Fire. My wife's old off-brand, Android based tablet also works flawlessly.  I really wanted to like this tablet, but I am truly frustrated with it.

"83",83,2,"The device is good for an adult with an account or possibly for one device shared amongst family members.  Unfortunately, my daughter bought this with her birthday money and Amazon does not have good programming options for children in a household with their own device.  So after speaking with a Rep. from Amazon three times, it has been determined that these are my three options and their flaws. 1). The Free Time app. -  Is good for controlling some things like books, music and some apps. However, it limits the child to those items only.  Under the Free Time app they can not take photos, videos, skype, or any other ""fun"" apps they would enjoy.  2). Parental controls.  Under the parental controls you can not turn off the cloud option in books.  This allows the child to see all your books in your library.  They can swipe between the two indiscriminately. This eliminates the need to choose which books you choose to download to the device as they can read all of them.  3).  Set up their own account.  If you have Prime (as I do), you can not share it (you can share prime for shipping but not videos, books, etc.). So that membership fee looses value.  If you purchase a book for your child, you have to gift or loan it to them.  You will also need to set up an e-mail for the child as well.Amazon is a big company and I am disappointed that they can't do this better.","joy","negative"

"86",86,22,"I recently purchased myself this 4th generation Kindle Fire 6"" HD device during Thanksgiving as an upgrade over my 1st generation Kindle Fire.First things first... you will want to get yourself a case for this, as it's it's at a size that feels awkwardly big and small at the same time, and you don't want to accidentally drop it (which is easy, since it also felt heavier than I would expect for something that size).  However, it'll probably be difficult to find a case for this device in stores due to it's unconventional size.  I tried at Best Buy and a couple stores, but eventually ordered a ""MoKo Fire HD 6 Case - Slim Folding Cover"" from amazon a week later, and it does the job.  Build Quality wise, this device feels solid!  it doesn't ""bend"" or feel plastic-like.Speed.  This thing is fast, at least way faster than my old Kindle was.  It's quick to start, and very responsive.Reading.  Slightly smaller than my old Kindle, it will display less words per page.  Easy to read, just like my old Kindle.Video.  The video on this thing is awesome!  HD quality, and very sharp.  My only complaint with the videos is that there's not enough space on the device for me to download any HD movies for offline viewing.  I'd think 8 GBs would be enough, but with the few movies I tried to download, it complained about space.  When I tried downloading in lower quality, it worked.  Either I need to try a shorter movie, or not download in HD.  As far as watching streams though, it's great and works flawlessly.Sound.  I'm not qualified for rating sound, since I have a hearing disability, but when I plug in my earbuds and listen to prime music, it sounds great.  As far as the speakers, they work and I can hear it when it's turned up all the way.  As far as quality of that internal speaker, I think it's suffice, but you'll probably be like me and use earbuds.Apps.  I only installed a few apps on this thing, like Youtube, Twitch, Spotify, Pocket, etc... and they work fine, just like they would on an android device.Camera.  I only took one picture with the front facing camera, and it was alright.  Fortunately my image didn't break the device.  I don't intend to really take pictures with my kindle, and I haven't bothered taking any photos with the back facing camera.  For simple photos, I think it's more than acquit.Battery Life.  So far, it seems to be pretty good with battery life, but has a little bit less capacity than my old kindle had, but considering that this does much more stuff, and last hours and hours and hours before requiring a charge, I'm not worried at all about it.About the ads... there are ads on the lock screen.  Meaning nothing more than that, which you simply swipe to unlock (that's 1 swipe, not 2 or 3).  You're not forced to buy anything, or click thru a bunch of surveys and I wouldn't bother paying extra to have them removed.  They aren't annoying or intrusive, and you only see them on the lock screen.  If you liked an ad that you swiped past, you can view them under ""Offers"" in the menu.Shopping.  Shopping on this thing is easy.  I purchased my case for this kindle via from this kindle.  I also purchased a few kindle books.  The whole experience was straight forward and easy.  For those who want to set restrictions (due to children, etc), there are settings you can set, but I haven't really played with them.Amazon Prime service.  Lets all be honest here, the kindle fire is really an Amazon Prime consumption device. Obviously, if you're not utilizing Amazon Prime, then this device's killer features will mostly be overlooked.  Sure, you can watch youtube on it, but the Prime service is what really makes this device ROCK!  With a Prime subscription, you'll have access to all sorts of music and videos, that without, I'd have a hard time justifying purchasing a kindle fire over a generic mini-tablet.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my Kindle Fire HD 6 purchase, and it has been at my side pretty much since purchase, effectively replacing my old Kindle.Pros:Fast response (software/hardware)HD video playbackGreat with Amazon PrimeBuild Quality feels solidAffordableCons:Heavier than I expectedKind of an awkward size, like an oversize smart phone, hard to find cases for.Not enough memory to download HD movies for offline viewing (at least for me)","joy","neutral"
"87",87,8,"This is my third Kindle. I had the first generation, then the HD 7"", then this one. I did a lot of research and comparison shopping before I bought this one. I was torn. I wanted something smaller than the 7"" (and in this case it was the only one of any brand that was smaller than the 7"") but the HDX 7"" was a lot sleeker than this one. This one has got some bulk to it. Surprising bulk for such a compact size. And it's boxy compared to the HDX 7"". However, I stuck to my desire for a smaller Kindle and I am not disappointed at all. I LOVE it! I really like reading magazines on it. For such a small screen they've done a great job of presenting the magazine pages in a way that makes them clear and easy to read. And, the resolution, WOW, I can see a huge difference between my old HD 7"" and this one. This one is truly beautiful. I guess some are bummed that this one doesn't have the Mayday function on it, but that has never appealed to me. A chat session or email is just fine with me. This one has turned out to be everything I wanted and has surpassed my expectations in many ways. Well done, Amazon, once again!","joy","positive"
"88",88,4,"WARNING! Does not support Google ANYTHING. I even tried getting the APKs to do it myself but it wont support half of those either. I didn't really do my research on this because I didn't really care that much, but for anyone else, If you don't like any apps associated with Google, then this would be ok for you but there are other tablets out there that would still be better. This is essentially a glorified Kindle. Which would be fine, but it's not really advertised that way.","joy","positive"
"89",89,6,"I purchased this tablet for my 4 year old son as a substitute for the iPad he favored. I thought this would be a good buy given that you can place more restrictions on it than the iPad and with three Kindle Free time it seemed more kid friendly. We have been using the tablet for a month now and I have to say I am very disappointed! To start, the memory on the Kindle is crap. Every app, game, book, pretty much everything has to be downloaded to work. It states that the device has 8 GB of memory but my Kindle is currently at 4.88GB used and says to only have 184.MB left. That doesn't add up to 8GB. It's frustrating since you have to constantly delete items in order to connect to WiFi and use the tablet. Then when you go to delete items the majority of the apps taking up space are all system applications that you cannot delete! And honestly don't even use! It would be nice to delete those preloaded apps to get more space for the apps you want. It would be better if you could add an SD card or some type of external storage device to add more space but you cant! I am getting ready to send this back and purchase the iPad. At least the internal storage space can handle all of the downloads needed.","joy","positive"
"90",90,7,"I love this Kindle. I have bought a bunch of tablets including the 1st generation ASUS Transformer, IPAD 2, Samsung Tab 2, Nexus 7 I/II and this one. This is cheapest one in my army of tablets, but surprisingly it might be the most powerful one. Its wifi is so good that I can watch HD Prime video at every corner of my house. I purchase it mainly for my kids. My daughter loves it and always calls it ""little IPAD"" and said the little is better than the ""big IPAD"". I don't think Amazon is making good money from the $99 gadget. It should be a trap to steal your bucks when you use it to buy books, audio/video contents. I have been Prime member for years. Even we can watch so many videos for free, I still bought a couple of movies for my kids. Anyway, it is a good buy, especially for young members of my family.","joy","positive"
"91",91,2,"I bought my daughter the Kindle fire for her birthday and a week later it no longer works.  It just keeps turning on and off, I can't even reboot the Kindle because it doesn't stay on long enough to reboot it.  Very disappointed because I was going to purchase a Kindle for myself but I'd rather pay extra money for something more reliable.","unknown","negative"
"92",92,0,"I have an older Kindle Fire, and I was looking forward to an update. Unfortunately, the one I got wouldn't ever connect to Wifi, so I couldn't even make it through setup. Amazon wasn't helpful and didn't offer to replace it with another unit, so back it goes. It might be a good product, but sadly, I will never know.","joy","positive"
"93",93,4,"This tablet is perfect for me.  I like to take photos, and share them via e-mail.  I trust Amazon products, and the new Fire HD tablet is exactly what I needed, as I don't want to pay $50 or more per month for a cell phone with a costly plan.  And I don't have to use my (old) camera and then download the pics to my pc anymore.  All the photos I take on my Fire HD tablet get stored in the Amazon cloud!  (No more photo albums.)  I can send the photos directly from the Fire tablet to my family and friends via e-mail.  And, the Fire HD is a great price and takes great photos!  Everything you need to change the photo comes with the tablet; you can adjust, crop, rotate the photos, etc., and it's easy to use.","joy","positive"
"94",94,8,"Perfect size and weight for travel, for watching and reading in bed at night; excellent video and audio quality, very user-friendly and easy to set up apps; nice reading quality with built-in tools that are interesting and fun to use: a quick dictionary, for example, just by highlight a word with your finger, or highlighting simply by dragging your finger down the text. I love it. Plus, forgive me, but it's really cute! I love the size.","anger","positive"
"95",95,23,"A little background information about me- I've never owned a tablet, though at one point I borrowed a friends 2nd edition ipad, and that was a joy to use. I have an iphone 5 and recently the new 6 and 6 plus came out. I love my phone, and I love the size of my phone and how easily it fits in my hand. I use my phone for everything- including my nightly 2+ hour reading sessions. The reading sessions on the 4 inch screen of my iphone are especially painful for me, so I was debating about upgrading to the 6 plus and /finally/ being able to read on a decent sized screen. However, besides reading, I didn't want a bigger phone, I really like my phone the way it is... But the reading was difficult... What to do....And then enter the Fire HD 6. I am SO happy. I immediately drove down to my local big electronic store the day it came out. They had some in stock, but they weren't even out on display. They kept trying to sell me the older editions, haha, but I waited an hour or so while they found one (still in the back, apparently, it hadn't made it's way to the floor yet!). Now I don't have to upgrade my phone to read and i'm so pleased.My thoughts on the fire hd- The 6"" size feels just right to me. I read a lot of fanfiction (nerdy) and I just go to the website in the silk browser, tap on the ""reader mode"" button, and scroll down as I read. The device is small enough that I can easily grip it in one hand and use my other hand to lazily scroll down the page as I read. It's visually beautiful, everything looks so clear and vivid during my two days with it so far, and the os is simple and easy to navigate. I've never had an android device, and I wasn't looking to replace my cellphone and this IS my first tablet, so so far I feel like all the apps I've wanted were in the app store. Unless you're looking for smaller ones, I don't think you'll have any issues with the amazon apps. I don't know if this is unique to the fire or unique to android, but when I plugged the USB in to charge to my computer, Fire HD immediately told me this was a slow charging port and it would take awhile to charge. Wow, I've never had a device tell me that! I switched to a wall outlet, and it charged perfectly fine.A couple of negatives-- I feel like it picks up fingerprints easier than some of my other devices, but they're easy enough to wipe of... and no Chromecast support! This is actually huge for me, because it means I still need my iphone to direct my TV. I have a chromecast stick and a roku stick- and I generally prefer to use the chromecast since it can also cast from my PC, which is nice. However, when I am in the Plex App, or the Netflix App, it only seems to be able to cast to the Roku player. It does cast to the roku fantastically though, so I am happy for that... But the no chromecast thing means that this device cannot be a living room hero for me. I would have loved to be able to retire my phone to the charger while I was home, but it looks like I'll still need it to control the TV. However, I dont think this issue will affect most people, but it effects me, so I took a starAnother thing to note is the speaker location, which is on the back of the device instead of the bottom. It IS true that with certain hand positions, you're actually blocking the sound, but I actually love the speaker placement. When watching a video in landscape, if you're holding the device with both hands, my hands naturally make a sort of ""cupping"" hold around it (just my natural handplacement) which actually amplies the sound towards me.I dont feel like the touch screen is quite as ""on point"" as my phone, sometimes I need to click something a couple of times to make it do what I want... but overall, everything is so fluid. I got SO MUCH MORE out of this then I expected for such a cheap device.","joy","positive"
"96",96,4,"This has been one of the best investments I have made for quite a while. It does everything my wife's Kindle Fire does and more. Plus it was 1/2 the price. I couldn't be happier.

"97",97,-1,"Really disappointed. Initially thought I could live with the quirks, because the price was right.-My Fire locks up all the time, essentially, whenever it finishes a download, or gets unplugged, it has to be completely shut down and restarted to get out of the blank screen.-Fire takes forever to download ordered items, as compared to other services.-Touch screen tech is sup par, what prompted me to write this review was this morning, after banging away with my finger 7 or 8 times on a link, finally saying ""forget it"" and going to my lap top.It was just then that I realizes that the quirks are bad enough to have me too frustrated to even try using it, no matter what the price, it was not worth it.","sadness","negative"

I was prepared to buy a 6"" phone to use as a tablet. I was excited when Amazon release t h e HD6. I was very disappointed when I found out that the services I use the most couldn't load on a different type of Android tablet. I can load Google Services on any Apple Device, but not an Amazon tablet?I understand how Amazon wants people in their eco system. The problem is that Eco system is incomplete without Google Services. Samsung has its own Eco system and software over lay on Android, and still allows Google Services.Amazon is a great place to shop online. Your tablets, and even the Fire Phone is a great way to give people access to the Amazon Market place. And with Amazon Prime as a service, Amazon is growing stronger as a brand each day. It doesn't need to block out Google Services to stand out as a brand.","joy","neutral"
