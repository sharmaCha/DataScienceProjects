1,ill preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting atablet to perform at anywhere near that leveli have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured id give the kindle fire hda tryi chose the basegb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary ereader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet accesswhat ive found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and laggy speeds mentioned in the early reviewsin fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the years best purchasefirst off the look is nice its sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than id imagined its not heavy enough to be considered a negativethe display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate responseto the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasantly surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to intuitfor those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide youi first checked out the ereader functionmy books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the readeri am a big fan of the kindle app for the ipad and am far more accustomed to its functionality but the fire performedvery well and my only complaint is that when searching the definition of a word wikipedia is used versus google on the kindle for ipadphone apps which is a step down in quality imo but certainly a small complaint overall and in the quickorwords i searched the answer was attainable from that page and did not require going over to the wikipedia page as some have reportednext i checked out silk the web browserthis aspect of the fire probably received the most complaints as the early reviews came init was reported to lag and to crash frequently even on amazons own sitei expected this to be the case as i tested it but i found that these problems must already have been addressed your tablet loads the newest version of the software upon your registration in subsequent updates as my experience was the ability to browse quickly and flawlessly across a number of varying websitesthis was the second surprise for me as i expected a far lower quality and especially a slower speed i couldnt be happier with what ive experienced so fari browsed the app store and found it very functional and easy to maneuver i set up my gmail within a matter of seconds and i looked through a variety of sales and offers at no time have i found slow speeds poor touch responses or any laggingthe kindle fire hd has exceeded my expectations in every way and i still cant believe i got it fortaxthis thing is an incredible bargain and so far its quality of performance holds its own against my ipad something i absolutely did not expect at this priceim sure as i become more familiar with the fire the reasons for the price difference between it and the ipad will become more apparent but when you consider the main reasons for which i purchased the fire it holds up marvelously wellagain this may be the years best purchase from a value standpointso fari wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyoneenjoyupdatesince writing this review back in october ive purchasedmore for my kidsin perhaps the greatest test of speed and function namely being easy fast and fun enough to be preferred by children these tablets have continued to impress and have proved that they are indeed a game changer in the world of budget tablets withmonths of rather heavy use under my belt i have experienced absolutely no technical difficulties and i remain a very satisfied customer i therefore continue to highly recommend this excellent tablet,positive
2,if you read my fire tv review you know that i am tough on amazon when it comes to their own items it needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions i will do my best to respond to them as i can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things i discover along the wayfirst my background i own many amazon kindles bw fire gen fire gen as well as apple ipad gensamsung noteand have an lg g smartphone had a samsung s before that notebooks chromebooks etc i have also used many other products including the fire hdx line i have a solid computer background as well but honestly i am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this oneamazon has changed many things over the life of the fire product line adding and removing features like camerasthe first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are backthey are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to younow to this model this is like a big smartphonewhich is a big difference from past kindles it is more compact lighter and yet still very usable in fact for me the shrinking of size increases the usefulness i find that i use my smartphone way more than my tabletseven the smaller fire hd and samsung note tablets so i am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones that means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops i am guilty of boththe screen is very goodcertainly not the top of the line but nice even if you factor paying twice the retail for it it is bright sharp with the same resolution as pastcomparing past kindle firesst generationinch xpixel resolution atppind generationinch xpixel resolution atppird generationinch xresolution atppi the first step up in resolutionth generationinch xppi this is the twin to this model and was just releasedwhereas thisinch model hasxppi that makes this display higher or the same resolution than any of the past kindle fires with the exception of the more expensive hdx it makes it sharper with more detail per inch than any of the past kindle fires of this smaller size again except for the hdx yet this is the cheapest fire yet which is quite impressivenow while amazon may love my giving thisinch fire astar rating they wouldnt like this next sentence there is absolutely no reason to even consider the newly releasedinch firemore gets you a less sharpdetailed screen more weight more bulk look at the extra space on the sides next to the screen of the newinch and the newinch and the only improvements is a second speaker and a larger screenin my opinion you should consider thisinch fire or consider spending twice as much to step up to the fire hdx with many improvements mayday button higher resolution faster processor dualband dual antenna mimo wifi and longer battery life the hdx has some issues with a blue halo around the screen so read reviews of that before jumpingso now that i have talked you out of the fireand covered some of the reasons for considering the firehdx lets talk more about the fire performanceappsit is quick but i am never happy enough lol responsive and like apple productsit just works now one plus and minus with all kindlesfires are that you can not use any app from googles app store that means you have to wait for apps to be brought into amazons app store which seems to be slow at getting new releases and new updates this is really an issue for amazon and one that still needs to be fixed the plus to this is that amazon keeps some of the junky apps out of the system and once they make it to amazons app store they are proven safe and generally work better than the fresh apps because bugs have been worked outamazons own apps are very well integrated into this and past fires they keep improving them and adding features without adding cost if you have prime you get streaming tv and movies free ebooks and now prime music if you have prime the added free content you get on the fire makes it a real standout against everything elsei use my firefor reading emails surfing the internet watching videos some of the time and playing some gamesapps like imdb i have found that it meets or exceeds what i have come to expect from these things in terms of performance and reliability are there bugs or glitches yes but less than my lg smartphone has and less than my samsung tab hassizeabout the size of the new large phones is very nicenot too big but not too small it is more portable feeling than theinch tablets and it is easy to hold it is fun to be part of the cool club without droppingtimes as much or signing ayear contractqualityamazon has proven overtime that they can make quality products and this is no exception at under a hundred dollars there is pretty much nothing else that is this feature packed with this finish quality i have experienced no quality issues and do not expect anything given amazons solid historybattery lifeso far so good i was able to stream video and surf the internet for well overhours without any hiccups from a device this compact with such a large screen that seems quite impressivesounddecent but apple products are cleaner sounding to me volume is usable in most situations but not necessarily in noisy outside situationsi am sure i have forgotten something so please feel free to ask questions this is my own opinion and while i dont know everythingi do my best to deliver honest reviews since reviews help me so much when i shopif you are in the market for a little tablet and have prime you have to decide between this fireor theinch hdx for twice the cost thisinch adds the rear camera and most of the performance while being smaller lighter at half the price,positive
3,for the low price this tablet really does more than expectedthe camera isnt great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesnt effect mehere are some of the pros and conspros low cost yet high techgreat screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as issmooth and responsiveeasy access to amazon prime contenteasy to wirelessly share content to a tvbattery lifeweb browser works greatcons doesnt have some apps android users are used to havingcamera quality isnt great and no flashless extra features than some higher priced tablets havei opted to go with the gb version with no adsthe ads arent a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screenno matter what version you pick they all do the same thingsthe gigs may or may not matter to youandgigs both arent very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows moviesmusic before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gigif you will always have internet connection then it isnt much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internetoverall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the hdx serieshowever if you want an amazing tablet but dont want to spend as much then these new hdseries are greatfor me and my uses the hdis the perfect fiti would suggest theover thefor most buyersthe onlythings thehas over theare a larger screen and dual speakerssure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than theat ppi thekeeps the same resolution as its last rd generationthehowever has ppi which make its screen a bit more crisphere are some of my thoughtssize the size is goodi prefer that it is a smaller size for ease of carryingas long as you see well up close thisis a great sizebattery life very sufficient for my needsthe kindle hdxs have a little longer battery life however thishour specd battery life has been lasting a long time and never getting too low for my usessound sound isnt badit is comparable to a laptop from a few years backthehas only a mono speaker but it is loud enough and crispi find it is plenty for watching a tv show or moviefor music i prefer a speaker or headphonesbut that goes for pretty much any tabletcheck out my youtube earthling for some more information on this tablet,positive

5,im starting off my saying im not just antikindleive owned an original kindle and a nd gen kindle fire hd i loved them bothmy husband owns one he loves it my kids played mine all the time so much they loved themso for christmas we decided to get my older two children their own kindle fires we selected this model due to a tremendous price discount on cyber mondaywe opened them up at christmas and now my daughter is constantly frustrated she continues to get a message warning her that storage space is getting low and it shuts the wireless connection down so she cant watch the streaming video that is part of kindle freetime or even download the little games in freetimeso being the tech family we are im an it tech my husband is a computer engineer so we arent stupid when it comes to tech devices we began looking into thisi know that this is the gb model i see that it is advertised as above as havingof that gb available for the useri call bs on thatsee attached photoof the entiregb available according to the above advertising you get considerably lesswhy is amazon telling me that i get that much space available when their system applications stuff i cant uninstall either take up some of that space and then system files take ofof a gig on this one andof a gig on my sons kindlewhen i click on system to see what it includes it says this catergory includes system cache logs texttospeech files and other system files i cant see what it isthese people knew how much of their random system files and settings would eat into my storage spaceso dont give me a little sales pitch that i getwhen i dontso i did some diggingmy husbandsgb kindle fire hd nd gen lets us know thatgb are availablewhich means the android os the kindle fire os thats on top of the android system and all the system files and behind the scenes stuff are planned to take upgbwhich would be about rightsystem files user accounts system settings etc use up aboutgb of the advertisedgb of user storageso amazon should be honest and sayyou get gb of storage not im highly disappointed in this its frustrating and disappointingmy personal recommendation to friends and family will definitely not include this type of kindle again,negative
6,i was very surprised to find that i absolutely love this little devicesurprised because i had the very first fire and the very first fire hd and ended up giving them to family members because i just didnt like themi was hesitant to try theinch since i didnt like theinch and was pleasantly surprised to find that i really really liked itit was easy to set upemail and my amazon purchases loaded very quicklyi have the kindle pw but usually do all of my reading on the ipad mini kindle app due to the fact that i like the larger screen over the pwi only use the pw when i am reading at night in bed if i cant sleepthat is why i am surprised that reading on the fire hdis just so nice and appealingi like the feel and build of the fireit is heavier in the hand than the pw but the heaviness adds to the feeling of qualityit has a nice solid feel and is very comfortable to hold one handedthe screen for viewing videos is absolutely beautiful i think better than the ipad minii bought this mainly to have the text to speech function and it worked very well with the book i was currently readingthe speaker is not that bad but i almost always use headphones so the mono speaker is no big deal for megb is not a lot since you really get less than that for your own content but i currently have two episodes of soa on it an audio book one game and five books and i still have just under gb left to usethe battery life is pretty goodmuch better than the previous fire hd i had triedi use the ipod touch at work mainly to stream the instant videos and my music never liked reading on it but with the larger screen on the fire hd my ipod is going to be sitting at home while the mini fire is going to be my constant companionnow on to my complaintswhich are very fewi wish the back of the fire hd was a little more skid resistant and i really wish the lighting could be turned down to almost blackfor me at the lowest setting it is still way too bright to use comfortably in a dark roomi know there is an app out there to help with this but the device should be able to accommodate almost zero light itselfalso i really wish that amazon would adopt the swipe up and down the screen to adjust your light settingkobo was able to do this to their aura hd with a firmware update and i really wish amazon would do this tooa truly immersive reading experience should mean being able to make all your adjustments while still reading without having to stop reading and go thru menus to reach the settings you need ambient light sensor is still having the device decide what is best and you still need to make adjustments to what you likeall in allgood job on this oneits small enough to go everywhere with you and heavy enough to feel well builtupdatei never thought i would ever say this because i always have loved my ipad minibut i am reading more on this little fire and my mini has been sitting in the drawer ever since i unboxed the fire,neutral
7,first let me say that i love amazon and feel it truly provides a great shopping place for momsi buy many items in which i am very happy with through its website and this is perhaps why i am so disappointed with this purchasei do not make snap decisions and take time to research an item before buyingi also rarely spendon any given itemi bought this tablet because of the marketing done on the product and what the commercials said this tablet was capable ofi saw the commercial where the tab slid off a car hood and survived hitting the concrete as well as the commercial where it took a tumble down the stairs and lastly the tumble it took in the tumbling mechanismmy tablet was not so fortunateit took a mereft fall and the screen shattered beyond the point of usethe commercials lead one to believe it should be able to survive this but mine did nothad i known it was going to be like all the other tablets out there i would have taken better precautions to ensure it didn’t have a chance to breaki feel that amazon has wrongly misled its customer’s in its marketing efforts to sale this producti have only had the tablet formonths and am no longer able to use iti called amazon to voice my concern and was not offered much other than a replacement that cost me almost as much as a brand new deviceso be cautious if buying this tablet it is just like all the others out therebuy a case to protect it and treat it as you do your other devices as it is not indispensable as the commercials claim,positive
8,its fine just like my last one that was stolen i need to formiliarize myself all over again,negative
9,ordered this for ouryear old to replace her first generation kindle fire during setup i found out that amazon has intentionally blocked all casting from the latestupdate to chromecast not even netflix will cast with this as it has with our oldkindle fire it will be on its way back to amazon shortly,negative
10,incredible little machineads on the main pages but they are not bothersomefunctions totally intuitive no learning curve at alli hated the kindle bought a nook and amazon has now done the hardest thing in retail they have earned back a customer they lostcombine the quality of this product with prime and their renewed commitment to actually serving the customer and they are unbeatablei have an ipad and this device completely replaced it inhoursdoes everything more reliably and more intuitivelyabout the only thing the ipad still wins at is linking with itunesso if you are an itunes music only person this might still be a difficult questionbut this fire does everything else better than my ipad email videotv web browse readerthe app war still hinges on android being twitchy cheaper wider and apple being more reliable narrow pricier but i rarely use apps except games which are fine either way if anything they are better organized and easier to get at on the fire if you are a gamereverything is easier to get at heremuch better devicemuch less expensiveway way better customer servicei rarely leave reviews but amazon has hit the retail ball out of the park with prime and firethey are winning againcongrats,neutral
11,i have had the tablet for a week i am a member of the apple evil ecosystem with iphone s ipad mini ipad air and macbook air while having another tablet is a bit absurd the fire hdis much more pocketable than the ipad mini and much less expensive to replace if lost therefore the niche i use it for is to carry it around while out and about much like my iphone with its most direct competitor being the iphoneplus but with a screen just big enough to read comfortablyi might use it as my alarm clock since the clock has an excellent night stand viewsince i am not a member of the googleandroid evil ecosystem inability to use those appsmusic is irrelevant to me if anything i would want the fire to be more like a cheaper smaller ipad i would like my apple newsmagazine subscriptions to be fully usable with fire apps my national geographic subscription works fine on the fire as does my nyt digital subscription but the fire nyt app is more limited than the apple one however there is enough common appsinteroperability eg outlook exchange onenote not to mind leaving the apple realm and entering the amazon dominionthe build quality of the tablet seems solid though thinnerlighter would be nicer and battery life and screen quality are excellent the accuracy and fluidity of the touch screen are comparable with an ipad the tablet seems quick but sometimes lags but so do my ipads i have not found the software to be buggy most steps and features are fairly consistent with other tablets and therefore are not hard to learn amazon should consider adding a may day option that users could purchase if they are new to tabletsthis tablet is best for something thats easy to pocket but big enough to read many could use it comfortably as a primary tablet but a higher end amazon tablet would better fill that role the size of the fire hdalso seems to eliminate many reasons for having a kindle device except for reading in the sun or next to a lightsensitive bed mate,neutral
12,i bought this for my sonyear old for christmas he loved it everything was great the sound the speed the clarity awesome it had all the games and books and music awesomebut he was outside today and it slipped from his hand and fell on the ground and the screen shattered he isso the fall could have been not more thanfeet he did not throw it down it slippedi called amazon to see if there was something that could be done it was onlymonths old nope i was told a dropping the device voided the warrantythere is no repair kit or vendor but she could offer me a discount ofa six dollar discount from the current price i bought it forso not really a discount for me while understand that electronic are fragile when you see the commercials where kindles are dropped down a fight of uncarpeted stairs or fall off a vehicle on to the pavement without a scratch lets just say dont believe the hype,neutral

14,was everything and more then what i expected,positive
15,for the price you cannot go wrong with this tablet it actually does more than i expectedit is similar to the ipad mini that i used to owni actually have owned and still own many apple products but wanted to use this tablet to watch my prime videos and listen to music with the prime musicthe app store is okay for the kindle though not as good as the android and apple stores but sufficethe camera is an awful mp that is very noisy photography term for pixelatedthe mono speaker is such old technology the touch screen is not as responsive as my iphonethough these may seem like many complaints once again this product is less thanother tablets for that price were just phony toys for kidsyou could actually use this at your work or at schoolyou will not find a tablet like this from another company for under if you want to buy theone then formore you can i do like the fact that i can fit this in my pocket but is big enough to type notes and watch moviesi would recommend this product to my friends and family and to others and i will buy another one soon in blue in a couple weeks,neutral
16,warning if you have a limited data plan this device should only be used if you have unlimited or lots of data as it constantly transfers large amounts of data without notification even if you never stream video or musicthe first day we fired this up it used over gb of data just updating and installing free junk we did not request or wantwe paid extra not to get the adsand i would imagine that they constantly update and use even more datai have owned everykindle since the originalone and loved them allbut this one greatly disappointed mewe are rural and data is expensive but this device seems to assume that everyone has unlimited datathere does not seem to be anyway to limit its data consumption so every time you enable wireless you will have no control over how much data it usesthe touch screen seems far worse than the original fire requiring several taps to select thingsmy wife downloaded an audible book and when she tried to open it the second time the screen did not respond so she tapped it twice which then deleted the book with no notice very poor design and not nearly as well done as the original fire that we each use for hours every dayi spent my engineering career designing computers and i regard this as a device that should not have been released until the bugs were worked outbefore you sell a product the software should be updated and not require a huge update right after power upwe bought this for the size and bluetooth streaming but may have to return it if there is no way to fix the data consumption,neutral
17,if you love kindles you will love thethree of us in my household have the earlier generation kindle fire hd which we won’t part with one also has a very early kindle which he reads in bed used to it it has a light won’t give it upi am not quite an early adopter but close and i worried about buyingof these sight unseen one for my sister and two as prizes for children in a low income neighborhoodyesterday i asked my husband to try out reading his current book on a newhe didn’t put it down even though it as yet has no case and he is used to reading kindles like a book—open and closemy joy was finding all my music there all my books and emails etc who cares about the camera my husband is a professional and loves his various nikons he won’t use anything elsei care for those quick shots to capture the deer nibbling at my shrubs the dog doing something adorable the children caught in fun “i thought you were reading”i am reading no fabulous shots but it’s in my kindlei haven’t given it the full workout but i will before we deregister them and give them to worthy schoolchildrenbut they are so light and so reasonable i am thinking of buying one for my handbag… commuting airplanes doctors and dentists offices with their interminable waits coffee shops…and keeping my earlier joy the original kindle hd at bedside and syncingbased on this two day experience i won’t buy stock in amazon they can’t make a profit on these delightful and inexpensive,positive
18,let me stress that for the feature i enjoy most you must paymore to get the gb version in order to fully utilize though works with gb this is the feature that allows you to download a huge library of amazon prime free videos including many top hbo and showtime series as well as amazons transformed as i am on a trainhours a day this offline viewing is worth many times to price of this device just make sure you have the gb version as the gb version ultimately has only about gb free storage making it essentially a cloud device also when downloading videos i suggest choose the better downloading format which is the middle choice between lower and higher resolution and storage i find this to be perfectly acceptable from a viwing standpointoverall the screen resoloution and sharpness is better than i expected i agree that this can also serve as a terrific ereader and if you do not have an ipad a fun device to play games on i find the touchscreen not to always be perfectly responsive but am guessing this can be fixed by a software updatefantastic value overall,positive
19,i bought them for my boys its a perfect size for them they keep them on the charger while at school and can play them until time for bed its not my first time getting a kindle fire but first for my boys the quality is great and they are having a blast using them,positive
20,i have a kindle firest generation and i love it i didnt need the hdg tablet but i wanted something smaller and i love this size the price is so fantasticfor a tablet is such a deali wasnt sure how i would like reading on a smaller device but i actually like it better even better than my kindle ereaderi was pleasantly surprised to find that this little tablet really is much faster than my larger one and it seems to use less battery power i got lots of free apps and loaded it up with books musicand photos this didnt slow it down music does take up more storage than anything elsei had no trouble downloading books audiobooks music and pictures the tablet is very easy to navigate despite the smaller size i dont even need a stylusthis is my fourth kindle product i bought the st and rd generation ereaders and thetablet and they just keep making them better i have never had any issues other than a couple charging issues when thefirst came out but it was fixed quicklythestreams very quickly no glitches and looks fantastic it is faster than my laptop and larger tablet its amazingi do wish there was a flash for the camera especially since it is both front and rear facing i would use it more this is the only con i have foundthis is another great amazon product that comes with all the extra features they offer their customersi used to think people were crazy for reading on their phones but this isnt much bigger than some and i could read on this all day it truly is a stealupdatei am still loving this kindle i use this more then my ereader orfire i pretty much use it all the timedont get the battery saver app it would sometimes make the tablet freezei also like that on this fire i can have my reading background be a light green color i was using sepia on the other fire this may not be new to the hd fires but it is new to me and i like it,positive

22,i bought this tablet for myyear old son this past year i have spenton a cheap rca tablet andon a google nextbook thenon the hisense pro last year for christmas needless to say all of them have broke since thenfor being under adollars i cant praise it enough in comparison to the other tablets in that price bracket compared to the cheap tables i bought before this tablet is glorioussince i bought it for my son i really appreciate the sturdy structure very easy to hold and use for small hands but it also fits very comfortably in my own hands its actually easier to hold than my own tablet the fire hdxthe sleek back and pointy corners make my hands cramp up i think i dropped it five times on my face before i got the case which makes it a lot easier to holdthe picture looks fantastic for the price range very clear and bright no glare if youve bought cheap tablets before then you know how terrible the glare can be the sound is decent the touch is super easy and sensitive my son has no problems navigating through pocket minecraft added kindle unlimited freetime for kids and i am in lovei have had no problems with any lagging or crashes or even when ive stole it to surf on the interneti made the mistake of buying myyear old andyear old leappad s last year and greatly regret the money trap that comes with it games loaded directly onto the leappad range anywhere fromtoper game if your in the market for buying a tablet for your children you cannot beat this nugget with the free time cheaper full of games books kids movies that personally have my two younger kids drooling over my sons new tabletim waiting for the kids case to come out and it will be perfecton a different note i have thought about buying one for myself just to fit easily into my purse for easy reading when travelingi hope the price stays the same because i will be buying these for christmas gifts for pretty much all my nieces and nephews,positive
23,i love this tablet so far it does everything i need it to do this is my first tablet and im quite happy about it i was using the rd gen kindle its nice that its the same size as it the only drawback is that its hard to hold it up because its heavy i recommend the gb over the gb i think spending the extradollars for more space was worth it also it was nice that your amazon account came preloaded and all my books were ready to go for me as soon as i took it out of the box,positive
24,love love love coming from an apple fan owner of two previous kindles and the loving owner of an ipad mini its extremely fast compared to the original kindle fire and just really fast in general recommended for anyone but dont think it replaces an ipad if anything its a great sidekick and i do want to note how much this product has made me love amazon more and its great for teens because amazon was the first ever online shopping i ever did and the first time i could learn to buy things for myself it rewarding to wait for your products and unwrap them esp when you areand never had much of your own privilege of buying gifts for your family on your own,positive
25,i got mine yesterday and i cant stop playing with iti have a number of tablets and its my third kindle fire but its my firsttabletthat is its outstanding featureits a perfect fit in my hand when playing sudoku or other light games which are most of the games i playthis is going to be my first choice for little games from now onive watched a couple of tv shows on itim used to watching on a larger tablet but theyre fine on thiswhen i start watching my first thought is that im not going to like this small screen and the next thing i know im absorbed in the story and the screen is worldsized just like my larger screens when im watching a tv show or movieits easy to carry walking around the house while watching a show and i like thati listened to a few minutes of an audiobook and that works out nicelythe speaker is fine for that in my quiet houseits good and clear and has enough volumethere have been a few little problemswhen i type in a search phrase either in the browser or in the store about half the time when im a few letters into the description the keyboard disappearsive found that if i wait for whatever page im on to finish loading that doesnt happenim hoping this will be fixed soon in an updatein the meantime its a pretty minor problemive had a lot more and worse problems with ioson my ipad and with windows another problem is that when i adjust the brightness for reading it adjusts for the tablet overall so i have to adjust at the beginning and the end of each reading sessionthis needs to be fixed and it needs to allow lower brightness than it doesit also needs to allow more color options while readingthe sepia reduces contrast too muchthe background is improved but the text is now not dark enoughallowing us to control the text and the background separately would be much betteras it is i probably wont use it for readingi have a paperwhite so thats okay but id like to have been able to do more reading with this thing tooother than that its been very goodi wonder if this will start a new size trend among tabletsi wont be surprised if it doesbarry,positive
26,unboxing video of the kindle simple and shortthis is an amazing tableti upgraded from the original fire hd to this mini tabletwhy well first the original fire hd was getting outdated and a lot of apps i needed wouldnt work on itapps like dish anywhere did not work on the old fire hdnewer apps didnt work well or at all on the older fire oswith that being said i wanted to update to fire osfire osis a big big improvement from previous fire os systemsnew fire customers do need to keep in mind that even though fire os is based on android there is no google playyou have to use the amazon app store but i have never had any problems with thatwith the new fire os my dish network app works now the app store now has more apps and newer appsthe kindle works better with new amazon technologys such as second screen second screen did work on the original fire hd it came as an update but it was very sluggishnow with the new kindle it is fluid and works like it is supposed toanother reason i purchased this tablet was bc of its sizethis tablet will fit in your back pocket or cargo pants very easilyi know i could have got anotherinch tablet but for me theinch is the perfect sizei got into kindles originally because of their sizei dont use my tablet as a computer so i dont want a bigorinch tabletthisinch is actually my favorite size for a media devicei big plus is that amazon now includes the charger block again with their tabletsall formy original fire hd i had to purchase acharger block the block that comes with the smaller kindleinch is smaller which i likethis tablet has a much more powerful processor than the original fire hdit has two extra cores and the difference is very very noticeablethecore processor is great for multitaskingif you use services like prime music prime instant video or any other amazon service these tablets are a must they work much better than android or apple tablets using these servicesfire tablets also run apps like netflix fine so if you dont use prime netflix will work greatthe quality of this tablet is amazing have you ever felt the cheap tablets at best buyif so you know they feel and look like crap this tablet feels and looks like atablet very durable and seems to be very very well built they took time designing the tablet and that can be seen one example is the camera lots of phones and tablets put the lens flat with the back of the phone or tabletthe kindle lens is slightly lower than the back of the tablet why is this importantif you lay your tablet flat this keeps the lens from scratchinglastly i cant stress enough that if you plan to purchase this tablet thinking it is an android tablet ready to use google play and other android services you might be disappointedbut please dont purchase this tablet to leave it a bad review for something its not because its not an android google tabletits a kindle fire hd and its amazing once you get used to it special offers dont bother me plus i have found some great deals and trials through the special offersi recommend not paying the extra to turn off offers but that is just my opinioneditafter my first day using the tablet i can confirm it is a very big and welcomed upgrade over the original kindle fire hdthe screen looks much better yes it is the same resolution but the smaller screen makes it cleareranother function i have been really enjoying is the built in bluetoothi have been playing prime music on the tablet all day over my bluetooth speakersthe original fire hd also had bluetooth but the bluetooth on this new kindle seems to work much much better,positive
27,i may have been spoiled by hubbys nexus devices while only sportingscreens they make the most of the real estate and have fabulous visuals and specs to boot sadly the fire hd fails to meet my lofty expectations from the start it feels thicker clunkier and heavier though it is lighter than the larger nexusthe screen almost looks to be set further into the device its resolution isxppi which is a far cry from thexppi im used to for a stand alone reader that would be fine when a major selling point is full access to amazon prime features like the hd vod service that isnt so fine more on that later both sport corning gorilla glass both have front and rear cameras both have quadcore processorswifi bluetooth and access to a wide array of apps so since one is more expensive than the other youd be inclined to forgive the screen issues and focus on what amazon got right rightwhat amazon got right was the price sold for as low asrecently youd be hardpressed to find a quadcore device of equal build quality for less and with gb of ram it should handle light mobile games email and some light web browsing with aplomb but when you get to the software thats where things go off the rails for me amazon skinned over the lovely android os with their own proprietary features much to the detriment of the user experience perhaps its because im used to a pure android experience but the devices seems seriously hamstrung by the fire os you lose access to the google play store you lose access to a synced chrome and all its bookmarks with no way to import them you lose access to the device synchronicity youre accustomed to and youre forced into an ecosystem that is geared towards amazon consumption at the cost of being truly user friendly i found myself constantly frustrated by trying to do what ive been doing with my android devices for years now only have to try to learn amazons way of doing it instead yuck whats worse is when you get into heavy web browsing downloading or typing you get so much lag you want to fling the thing into the nearest wall all the ports are at the top of the device the single rear speaker is absolutely awful and the camera at mp is positively anemic though it does sport an hdr mode and a wide array of editing tools the pictures will never be anything to write home about especially in low light conditions the screen size is frustrating for me tapping and touching with normal sized fingers and hubby couldnt do squat with his much bigger hubby paws amazon does sport its own app store but more than a few of the versions of the apps available while seemingly identical to their google app and apple app store cousins are usually a few versions behind because lets face it there are two big dogs on the app block and it doesnt make sense to spend a bundle on development for the two little dogs with very little market penetration amazon and windows amazon has also locked the bootloader which means no third party development is available which is another huge upside for normal android devices and a hinderance for kindlesi like having access to my amazon prime benefits i like being able to stream my free video and audio benefits seamlessly i like the kindle features that go above and beyond the kindle apps available for all my other devices i like that it is small enough to drop in my purse and not know its there it seems to be very sturdily built with unobtrusive buttons that dont get hit accidentally and i like the price aside from that there is also plenty to make me say that i doubt id buy a kindle on my own any time soon the proprietary frustrating nature of the os the ads on the lock screen the focus on the amazon experience and not the customer experience the lack of synchronicity the screen and some personal experience the memory on my first device was corrupted and the charging port was borked amazon sent a replacement nextday air but after several rounds with their customer service chat to figure out how to connect the device to my tv for a true hd video experiencedifferent chats got medifferent failed methods i eventually gave up and resigned myself to asubhd screen for the foreseeable future i also dont know how i only havegb of space on a gb device when it arrives too small to download a movie and very little space for apps media or really anything ive used samsung galaxy devices lg devices asus devices and nexus devices kindle is dead last in my user experiencei wanted to like my kindle i wanted one for some time amazon shot for the moon with their kindle devices and instead for me shot themselves in the foot perhaps i expected too much if its for youngsters you have a relatively well built relatively inexpensive device that they can stream the occasional video play a few games and read a few books for a grown up youre better off buying a grown up device i received the above products free of charge from third voice marketingi am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review just my honest opinionmy review is based on my experience with the product andor brand which may differ from yours,neutral
28,pretty neat tablet but not too satisfied camera is not good and the screen breaks easy if drop maybetoinches high got it for christmas and use it formonths now its trashbroken screen will never be covered by their warranty,positive
29,if you are looking for a topnotch ereader forget buying a paperwhitefor less money the hd gives a great and easy reading experience with beautiful color and lightplus all the internet features you need for facebook email web surfing and youtube videosthis cant be beat,neutral
30,this tablet is terriblei ordered it for the conveniently portable size and my sisterinlaw loves her fire hdxhowever this little brother did not live up to expectations at allfirst of all although the hdstarted out working fast downloading and running apps with no problems after just a few minutes of use it began to bog down and lag behindwhile reading a digital publication i tried to scroll down to continue reading the page i was on and it started to lag behindit would not stay with my finger and the page began to move erraticallythen the text blurred and the screen got stuck in betweenpagesafter several seconds it finally caught up but was almost totally unresponsive to my touchi tried removing the apps i had downloaded and reinstalling them to see if that was the problemit worked perfectly for a few minutes again but then went right back to being slow and glitchy againim returning it today,neutral
31,very happy with it so far ive read surfed the web watched tv programs listened to music and taken a few picturesim not that tech savvy and im still getting used to it but i think this is a great product and would recommend it to family and friendsi will update this review at a later date if i run into problems,positive
32,i seriously do not understand the one star reviews if you read the product description which is very through you will understand that this tablet is amazoncentricfor the ability to do immersion reading listening to audio books while the kindle book reader highlights the words have access to prime video and music xray for prime video is amazing do some web browsing shop amazon and play a few games what is there to gripe about the tablet runs very smoothly has a very easy to use interface and lasts me a whole day before needing to be recharged i also love the case it has magnets that actually keep the flap in place in both the closed and open position the little crease in the cover allows the tablet to sit in portrait or landscape i cant imagine a better value for an entertainmentmedia consumption device if you want serious gaming or have major productivity needs then buy a tab s or an ipad both of which cost four times the price or more in case you can not tell by now i am very smitten with myfire hd,positive
33,i bought this for myyear old son this was the perfect purchaseit is small enough for him to carry around yet big enough for me to borrow at timesit even allows him to download a movie to watch in the car where there is no access to wifii love the parental control and freetime featuresi can require him to read books for a given period of time ieminutes before he is able to watch movies or play gamesi can also set it to shut down at a particular time on weekdays and set a separate time for weekendsthere are more than enough books games and apps for him to enjoy,positive
34,okay i will admit it i have always been a kindle skeptic i would consider myself pretty experienced with tablets but they have always been on the android platform i have heard mixed reviews about this particular tablet but let me tell you i was beyond impressed i never thought a little six inch tablet would pack this much punchthis does have a good weight to it which i like i opened this up and the setup process took less thanminutes it synced effortlessly to my amazon account and i can now watch movies look at photos and read my books with no issues i have experienced zero lag even after installing about a dozen apps the layout is a little different than other tablets but it was very easy to figure out everything loads very fast i think one of my favorite features is that it imports my photos to the cloud but has unlimited photo storage for pictures so i can access all of my photos from all of my devices it is great to have them all in one placeobviously this opens books like a dream the camera is pretty good for a tablet my phone has a better camera but i do not expect very high quality photos from a tablet this blew my expectations out of the wateri definitely recommend i received this product for review purposes,positive
35,for a tablet at such an excellent pricecompared to a whoppingfor my ipad i am beyond impressed with my new kindle fire hdthe hd looks pretty great i watched some netflix on it and wow the app store is very intuitive and i even enjoy reading books on it more than on my ipad i was expecting it to be lighter than it is for such a small tablet however it is not uncomfortable to hold even for long periods of timei was unsure about purchasing this with special offers but im very glad i saved the extraand got it with the special offers since they do not bother me the ads are only on the lock screen and home screen and does not affect reading or use of applications i think it is perfect for reading books and enjoying some fun applications as well i would definitely recommend this and think its a fantastic gift for a more than reasonable price i received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review,positive
36,i love this new generation of fire hd ive had kinde nd generation and an ipad mini i sold ipad mini and kept kindle now this fire hd will replace my old kindle now many people who give this devicestar reviews are upset about not being able to use google play store i am a very light app user meaning i only have aboutgames i play and two apps for videos my fire tablet has exactly same apps i have on my android phone amazon app store completely satisfies my needs why is this in my opinion better than ipad and at the same time worse because i use tablet only for watching tv shows on netflix and reading books havingipad just for that is a shame this tablet has a great screen very responsive video quality is amazing booksomg i love amazon libraryeverything is so cheap and as a prime member i get one book of my choice for free once a month super happy if you want to use your tablet for way more than thatlike do some work on it some heavy web browsing or gamingyou probably need to get a regular android tablet because this is not this is kindle fire made for watching videos and reading books primarily for having excess to huge music ebook and video amazon librarythats its main purpose know what to expect when you order it so you dont get disappointed i personally love it very much this great new size is perfect for just throwing it in the handbag and taking it with you everywhere just like you take your phone i highly recommend this tablet for everyone who feels this tablet is enough for them i know its definitely enough for me,positive
37,well to start off this was a decent little tablet that i had bought for my wifethe reason i am writing this review today is that i had the unfortunate experience of having seen the kindle fire hd drop test commercial on tvapparently it can fall off of a car and still workunfortunately with the one i bought that was not the casemy wife dropped it from a distance of aboutft off the ground and it landed flat on its back on a linoleum floor in the amazon brand origami casewhen she picked it up the screen was not cracked at all but there were lines and screen discolorationi email amazon customer service and they said that they would replace it but then i got a second email that stated they needed more informationso i used voice chat with a customer service representative and explained again what happened and that yes it had been droppeddue to it being dropped they would not replace it which i understood so i asked if they could repair it or give me a better price on one and send this one in so it could be refurbishedthey said they do not repair themso then i asked how much could you take off if i sent this broken one in so you could fix it and resell it as refurbishedi believe they quoted me atwhich seemed to be not such a fair dealso i just said no thanks and bought my wife a galaxy tabinchi know that the old galaxy tabthat i had was made with gorilla glass the fire hdcertainly is not as strong as the first generation galaxy tabas a matter of fact when you push on the screen you can feel it indent or give but with the galaxy tab there is no givei had even dropped the galaxy tab on its corner unprotected and it still worked but left a ding cosmeticallymaybe the short fall breaking the hdhas something to do with the tablets weight for its size it feels like a little brick and is quite heavyagain the only reason im reviewing this now is that i saw the drop test commercial and thought oh really just dont assume that you will get a replacement when it does fall as advertised,neutral
38,first of all let me talk about the price amazon is trying to compete with companies like apple and samsung for a spot in the tablet world and amazon found their competitors weak pointthe price the last time i checked you cannot buy an ipad for undernor can you purchase a samsung note for that price either although the hddoes not have the full range of capabilities that the other tablets have it is still an amazing piece for the price one thing that i did not like was the fact that i cannot change the wallpaper having used apple devices all of my life that has been common for me and even though it is kind of a small thing it still might matter to some peoplethe goodamazing pricesize is perfect for on the go peopleamazon customer service is very helpful if you need help operating the tabletmakes a great gift for anyonethe badalthough the amazon music store is good the app store is limitedthe headphone jack must be flawed because it sounds staticy when i plug it inwarningsdo not be fooled by special offers when you buy the tablet for the base price ofit automatically comes with this feature called special offers this gives amazon the right to put ads on your lockscreen although the ads do not interfere with the rest of the tablets features the lockscreen ads can be cumbersome occasionally you can opt out of the special offers formorealso go with theg model because theg model only comes withgigs of storage available to the user,neutral
39,ive used the regular kindle both original fire and fire hdnever liked the firesthought they were too heavy and they didnt quite fit in my handcomfortablyand being a diehard bibilophile i much prefer paper copybut im seriously considering one of theseprossmaller size doesnt make a noticeable difference surprisinglythe picture is very clear which helpsthere are a few apps that are just too small to use well but most do finesuper lightweight compared to kindle fireslight enough to keep in my purse all the time without getting scholiosisi thought the touch screen was more responsive than kindles which sometimes balk at my touchthe sides have this funny angling that makes it extremely easy to holdfits perfectly in my open hand without making my fingers cramp i have ahand span from pinkie to thumb if that helps give you an idea of my hand sizebattery life seems to be about the same as kindle hd but of course will depend on your use and settingswi fi pick up is fine in my house even thru the brick wall to the additionneat new featurein the settings you can change the type font size from small med or largethis is not the font size for books or the internetbut the fonts for the actual kindle the settingstabs and so forththe carousel is still there but if you actually select books they are arranged in either list or grid format with choice of au ti or recentstill no option for grouping by folders also when you go to home what you see are your most commonly used apps and some preloaded things like the camera arranged on one screenswipe down to find the carouselvolume control buttons on one side as with an ipadyour most used apps on on the home pageand at least some of the apps can run in the background like pandora while you use another appconsok it is smaller but still much bigger than most phone screensthe camera still shot quality is only acceptablex mag the attached flower photo was taken outside in full sun at arms lengthits a very peach toned flower by the wayif there is a manual to tell how to use the camera features i havent been able to find it yetno power light to show when its charging or done charging this is probably the biggest disadvantageand the screen reflectivity is still horrible in bright lightusing the camera in full sun is pretty much taking shots in the darkyou wont know what you got until you go back insidesummaryi give itstars for bad camera and lack of charging lightotherwise if you want a cheap tablet for internet access and apps and emergency reading i think this is really goodall the cool colors are great too,neutral

42,first let me say im a selfconfessed gadget junkie i own a myriad of electronics computers tablets ereaders mp players but ive never owned a kindle fire device until now i work quite a bit so usually pocket my iphone itouch and sometimes my ipad minir when leaving for the day ive always been attracted to the compact gadgets based on by lifestyle as hefting a heavy tablet or computer is never easy on the backwhen i heard about the fire hdi was intrigued enough to follow reviews in different forums for the past few days and hunt for any reviews of it on youtube i decided to bite and picked one up at my local best buy store this morning ordered online for instore pickup and had it unboxed and running in less than an hour it synced all my books music and apps that i had previous bought when i owned an android phone logged into my netflix and hulu plus accounts and tried out an episdoe to see how it would play there was absolutely no buffering and the sound quality was great i know some have said it doesnt compare to the other fire tablets but i found it meets and even exceeds my needs ive only begun playing with this little device but i know already it has become one of my favorites and will be coming with me wherever i go looking forward to the holidays and picking up a few of these for family members as the device will be a wonderful gift,positive
43,finally kindle text to speech that fits in your pocket i may need to get a life at some point but until then i can listen to tech books and nist special publications during myhour daily commute this will now take the place of my kindle fire hdxive managed to get through some pretty hefty certification books including shon harris excellent cissp allinone exam guidepage tome cover to covertimes during my commutethe only wish list items i have would be add areading speed or change the control to a slider to broaden the range of values sincecan be too fast for dense legal or technical content i use ezpdf reader pro for the slightly faster reading speed when listening to pdf files ignore pictures lines and symbols that might cause the tts to freeze or to misidentify the item such as currency for a poorly selected bullet item symbol or read underscore underscore underscore underscore for a header or footer line allow the disabling of acronym and abbreviation assumptions such as dr as doctor g as grams etc deearrh and gee would let the reader apply the correct context it does make for interesting reading when doctor is substituted for ever instance of disaster recoveryim totally thrilled with the new smaller form factor,neutral

47,i was sooo so excited upon hearing about the new kindle releaseswho can beat that especially for a great brand budget tablets and ereaders exist but i was never willing to sacrifice a better brand with better service even for the cheaper price basically all i wanted a tablet for was to read on im a librarian and frequently use our ebooks database as well as netgalley and kindle books ive been thinking about a kindle fire for ages but never wanted to shell out the money for it just to read on while the paperwhites are inexpensive they have limited features and i like that i can go into my goodreads app as well as facebook and web browse its very helpful for me when searching for new books to read and reviewingas i am not looking to do any heavy duty web work blogging emailing video watching music listening etc on here those functions are nice if i ever would need them but i cant talk about their functionality because right now i dont intend to use itif you are looking for an inexpensive kindle that is in a tablet form not the paperwhite this is absolutely perfect there are a few issues with being able to download my books that are not from kindle but after a couple of web searches i was able to figure it out if you are a dedicated reader that uses several platforms this is worth checking into it is a way better deal than shelling outfor an ipad mini if youre only intending to read on itim thinking about having our library purchase several of these to have on hand because they are so affordable and nice for readers i just cant get over how perfect this little tablet will be for reading on especially when traveling,positive
48,so far so good i have had my fire hdtablet for aboutweeks now and so far i love it in my opinion it is the perfect size its big enough to watch movies and surf the web but small enough to easily toss in your backpack purse or even your back pocket it is a little thicker and heavier compared to other small tablets some might think of this as an advantage and others as a disadvantage i personally think its an advantage if it was any thinner it would feel very fragile the screen image quality is amazing everything looks crisp and vibrant the speed of the tablet is decent it is very snappy when switching apps and browsing the web when i watch amazon prime videos it loads almost instantly without buffering the app selection isnt as large as other android tablets that use the google play store or apples app store but there is still a large number of apps that you can download its definitely larger than microsofts app store i have owned ipads an ipad mini galaxy tablets a microsoft surface laptops notebooks and all kinds of smartphones this fire tablet is by far my favorite device mainly because it was onlymost of my other devices costor more and werent a whole lot nicer or faster im not saying this fire tablet is the best tablet out there but it is definitely the best tablet out there for in summary here are my pros and consprospricedecent speedgreat graphicsportabilitydecent sounddurabilityamazon prime integrationchoice of multiple colorsunlimited cloud storage for picturesconsthicker and heavierapp selectioncant customize wallpaperssimple maybe even boring designbuy this tablet you wont regret it if you do you can always return it ps for those who are debating buying the tablet without the special promotions i recommend not doing so get the cheaper one because most likely you wont even notice them after a while if in the future you really dont like the promotions you can always log into your amazon account and pay an extrato disable the promotions,neutral

51,let me say first that this is my th fire and ive also had a k so ive been around the block with the amazon family im least pleased with this onethe speakers are wonky its very slow and im not sure the brain isnt about to blow its notably smaller than the fire s and s which isnt necessarily a good thing and the software is generally awkward i expect its about to take a trip back being it wont start now and its only a few days old the replacement is even worse than the first and it wont even turn on now that its hit the internet be warned that it is very very difficult almost impossible to reach fire customer service these days i only fell over it by accident the first time and now i cant find it at allvery disappointed in this amazon product i think ill go buy another fire,negative

55,i loved mine i really did but it had one serious flaw the standby battery drain every time i turned it on the battery had lostnothing i did helpedpowering off removing special offers turning the brightness down turning off notifications keeping it in airplane mode except to download a book deleting all my apps even re registering etc i had planned to call customer service this week but one night the battery hadleft and the next morning it was deadi had only managed to read aboutof my book so i de registered it and returned it to the amazon kiosk at the mall i intended to buy a new one without special offers but the kiosk didnt have any i will order a new one directly from amazon sometime my dil loves the one i gave her for her birthdayedited the second kindlea new one not refurbished is okay i charged the battery it lastedhours andminutes used only to read a book i think that is probably acceptable i agree with the people who think it is too heavy for its size i wish the app could tell me the hours minutes of actual use not just the percentage of life remaining at least one of the screensavers is too dark to see the keypad where you type in the pass code with brightness atand i would like to turn off the sleep wake feature,neutral

57,perfect price and great if you have kids i got this tablet just for my daughter and for me just to surf the net i really like the parental aspects of this device you can block anything that is not for a child but still be able to access the apps and other things with out having to hover over your child worried about what he or she is viewing i also like the size its a little bit bigger than a notephone in all its a great purchase for those reasons above,neutral

59,ive been sitting trying figure out why i like this thing so much better than my hdxit isnt as thinthe screen isnt aswell perfect it feels quite a bit heavierive been at a loss for a while now but i think maybe another reviewer said it bestthis thing feels great in your hand it feels substantial but not too heavy the screen is good enough so that when you use it you never think about the screenwell unless youre thinking something like i cant believe i got this screen for a hundred bucksin a lot of ways it reminds me of a paperback noveli loved those things by the waymore to the point i love reading because of those things i propose we all start thinking of this model kindle as the paperback novel of kindlesit is a more portable more affordable variation on the originalin just the same way the paperback novel was for the common person so too is the hdit is a good tablet with good performance a good screen and decent battery lifeand oh by the way it is one most people can affordand i will say something else which is im not sure any other hardware company could build a tablet this good and sell it at this pricei think amazons hardware designers are just that goodas someone who cares for value and who has done a good bit of research on so called value tablets let me save you some timethere are no other value tabletsnot this goodnot nearly this good this tablet makes all other value tablets look like a foolish waist of moneyplus it does things even my nexuscould never do like fit comfortably in my pocketi bought this device with every intention of trying it out for a week just so i could understand it a bit bettereven that decision was spur of the momenti chose the hd over a paperwhitegotta say i think i nailed that decisionalso i think i will be keeping this thing much longer than a week,positive

feedback or ambient light sensor not deal breakers for me in this price rangequick overviewthe kindle fire hdis an entry level tablet that really packs a punchi wanted to buy myyear old daughter a tablet for her birthday and really vacillated as to what to buyif you go too cheap all you get is an outmoded slow and clunky piece of crap that wont hold up over timeif you go the way of the basic ipad mini youre giving a kidpiece of technology to knock around in their backpackwhen the fire hdwent on sale forduring cyberweek the timing couldnt have been better and i went for iti havent had this thing for a long time granted but ive seen plenty of tablets in my day and for a kidand even an adultthis thing rocksthis may not be the latest and greatest technology but you would be hard pressed to find a tablet this refined and with this good of a user experience at a similar price pointlong reviewfirst and foremost when you buy the kindle fire hdyou are getting a sweet piece of well thought out technologythe thing arrived in exactlydays from purchase and was mailed in the nondescript cardboard packaging that amazon usually uses for medium sized booksinside was a simple cardboard container that amazon uses for their frustrationfree packagingbut when i opened the frustrationfree package i was more than surprised to see that they hadnt skimped on the presentationthe box for the kindle hdhas an appleworthy simplistic beautyyou shouldnt judge a book by the cover but the look of a gift is incredibly important and the quality of the packaging absolutely reflects the attitude of the manufacturer towards the productamazon hadnt skimped here and my daughters eyes lit up when she looked at the boxinside the boxinside the box you will find the carefully packaged kindle itselfa microusb charge cord and quick start cardthe device itself is machined well without any dogeared edges or superficial flawsthe device is made of plastic but it feels solid in your handsunlike most lowend electronics the onoff button and the volume buttons also have a firm feelthe chargesync cord easily fits into the kindles microusb portthere is no jiggling and no difficulty placing the cordin the past i have bought lower end electronics with cheap usb ports that dont quite fit or easily breakthis does not seem to be the case hereset uponce you turn on the device the tablet walks you through setting up your local wifi and you enter your amazon account informationonce done all your content on amazon is available to you all kinds of media and appsyou can then decide how you want to set up the devicefire os is not standard android but anyone who is used to technology the learning curve is easyi did have to consult the amazon website for a few particular things but basically once you set the device up you will beset to gothe user interface is elegant and a great skin on androidthe limiting factor of course is that you are stuck with the amazon app storethis is rather robust at this point but still lacks the sheer number and diversity of programs that you can find on google playnevertheless the kindle fire series gives youunprecedented ease in accessing all of your amazon contentadditionally this tablet is no toyit can do anything a runofthemill android tablet can dosetting up a kids account with appropriate restrictions is a little more complicated but well worth itim all for giving children major leeway but having the web at your fingertips with no restrictions on a device that can be used in private is a little too much responsibilitythe fact is that the kids accounts can be configured to give them incredible leeway but you can also restrict total amount of use time restrict the apps they can use and the ratings of the media that they can viewfor a parent this is a godsendthere is lots of help on the tablet itself when you set up a kids account and there is additional information on the webthe screeni dont know why anyone would complain about the screen no this is not the retina display of the latest ipad minibut atppi it beats the basic ipad mini which is atppi and comes incredibly close the the latest ipad airsppigiven theinch screenppi is quite an incredible amount of resolutioneven small text comes out as crisp and unpixilatedthe rendering of color the brightness and the viewing angles are incredible for a device that would cost twice this much let alone at this price pointis the screen as good as the one on the basic ipad miniit sure seems so to my eyesmaybe its the smaller form factor but there is no real compromise herethe screen is incredibly responsive to gesturesso far there is little or no lagthe tablet has yet to freeze or staggeri realize i have not been using it for more than a couple of days but i havent seen a better screen on anything in the sub categorykudos to amazon for thisrendering of movies and complex games was far better than i ever expectedthis is a media consumption device after all and it does this incredibly wellas an old guy i would like a bigger screenbut for the ipodsmartphone generation watching media on the small screen is second natureditto on web surfing and ebooksthe screen will render web pages full size with type that is readable for me only because i wear progressive lenseswith appropriate eyewear however web surfing is a pleasant enough experiencei would prefer reading my ebooks using a larger form factor but they are serviceable on the deviceat agemy daughter isnt bothered in the leastthat said with ainch screen this tablet is not much larger than most phablets out there so if i were getting a tablet for myself i would have opted for a larger form factoruser experiencein reading professional reviews of the tablet before purchasing a lot of ink was spilled regarding the wimpiness of the hd s mediatek mtghz processor and paltrygb of ramthe first observation i would make is that it is ridiculous to expect that a tablet in this price range will purr and hum like the topoftheline galaxy tab or supedup ipadsure the hdmay suffer in comparison on some benchmarksits still atablet nottotabletstillin my hands so far the performance has been more than snappythere is very little lag i think i have more lag on my iphone s for some tasksraw hardware is absolutely an important consideration but it is meaningless unless there is a good marriage between hardware and softwareamazon has optimized the experience for those who are interested in amazon content and have really done this brilliantlyit may well be that the higherline kindles do their stuff even better but even if that is the case the experience with the kindle hdis still greati will have to see how things go as the tablet gets filled up with apps or there is some serious multitasking going onbut so far so goodimportant issuestrade offswhat are the downsides herewell atthere had to be some compromises atmegapixels the rear camera is serviceable but by no means perfecti agree with most of the reviews i read previously the camera takes too long to focus and lowlight pictures are definitely blurryweighing in atounces the hdis something of a brick by modern standardsthe larger hdxis onlyounces heavier and has a larger screen and longer battery lifeclearly the lower end components simply weight morebattery life is slated at onlyhoursi havent tried this in real life yet but most companies overestimate battery lifeto keep costs down amazon had to make some decisions and clearly they opted for an older heavier lowerend battery to achieve thisstillhours at full tilt would have been pretty amazing battery life a few short years ago so its still not too badthe hdonly has a mono speakeraudio on these kinds of devices can never be truly high end theres no way to get a fullrange speaker on something this smallthe sound though is fine for a speaker of this size but its clearly a compromisesingle band wificlearly this will slow down the web but i didnt notice this at all using amazons silk browserno issues with download times but that all depends on your networklow memory on thegb model after accounting for the os and basic apps this apparently leaves only aboutgb of memory are left over for content and additional appsgb can store aboutsongs orphotos atmb per photonot badbut it takes aboutgb to store a movieso if you dont install any apps you could possibly storemovies on yourgb hdnot greatand sadly theres no microsd card slot for memory expansionthen again the purpose of this device is really streamingyou are allowed to cache movies for later viewing but the kindle is really meant to stream content not act as a repository for ityou could opt for thegb hdbut thatll cost youafter buying the tablet though i think buying the extra memory is well worth the cost of the upgradegiven cost constraints amazon has left out some common features seen on midrange and higher end android devicesthere is no gps no nfc near field communication for close proximity neartouch transfer of data with other devices no haptic feedback that buzz you feel when you type into the keyboard and no ambient light sensor allows for automatic adjustment of screen brightness among other thingsnone of these missing items is a deal breaker for me at this price pointi think the trade offs were reasonable to keep the low price point eg id rather have the better screen than the nfc haptic feedback etcgps would have been a nice touch but it is less useful without gg lte service which is not an option on this productfire osthis is both a pro and a con for this deviceon the one hand fire os is optimized to provide a great amazoncontent experiencethere is a great marriage of hardware and software hereon the other hand fire osis less customizable and less user configurable than stock androidits not that amazon hasnt added value here but in adding an excellent amazon experience you are stuck with choices that you may not have wanted to makethe interface is elegant and i believe enjoyable to use but its locked down and some usersespecially those who like to tinker a lot with their interfacewill not appreciate this factconclusioni was far more impressed with the kindle hdthan i could have imaginedit is a lowcost product that really delivers on a high end experienceit is certainly not a highend tablet but amazon packed a lot of value into the productyou get a lot more tablet than you purchasedif you are looking for a device for one of your children and you dont want to sacrifice an arm and a leg to the technology gods this ones for you if you are looking for a great holiday gift for someone who is entrenched in the amazon universe or are looking for an entrylevel kindle this just might be the onethis is by no means a highend tablet but it is insanely good for the price,positive
61,i had thekindle fire hdinch and i loved it when i saw that there was a new cheaper pink fire hd coming out i had to get oneive been playing with it for awhile now and i love it even more than my old fire first its pink the screen is very responsive like the old one everything works quickly like the old one and it has two cameras unlike the old one the front camera is basically the same quality as the camera on myhowever the rear camera which was absent on theseems pretty high quality it takes nice clear photos also my old apps work fine on this kindlealso i love the feel of this one it fits well in the hand it has a nice heft to it that tells you its not cheap junk but its not so heavy that its going to wear out your handoverall i have no complaints i figured that i wouldnt being such a devoted fire tablet follower i dont think you can go wrong with anything in the kindle lineupupdateafter a full day of playing with it i still have no plans to downgrade my review to four stars however i will say that i have now noticed a few of the quirks others were complaining about first off i have discovered a few apps that wont play on this kindle fortunately all the major ones work also the battery life is a little shorter than my original kindle fire hdspeed and responsiveness are barely if at all inferior to original hd volume is lower but you have to remember that the smaller size necessitates one less speakerthat might seem like i found a lot of problems but the problems are extremely minor plus the tablet costsif you got the gb like i did considering the tiny size and price tag these small flaws are perfectly acceptable in my opinionlove it,neutral
62,what an incredible subtablet i saw that these were available as a preorder had a bit overin gift cards burning a hole in my account and my daughter had been hinting that she would like a new tablet i seriously considered thefor a little more but after thinking about her usage habits and the way she does what she does online i went with theand a day after it arrived discovered i had hit a homerunshe loves the tablet she loves the size and she loves the color citron she had a tablet before a fairly awful piece of equipment that cost as much as this less than a year ago and was so bad that she never bothered using it much she has had the firehdwith her since it arrivedthe specs are good but dont really tell the whole story if that was the case then the noname chinese tablet i bought her last year would have been great it wasnt this tablet has good specs and more importantly works well everything she does it just breezes through no lag no hanging up or other undesirable behavior the battery life is great much much better than the chinese tablet with a battery rated at a similar capacityin the end i was hesitant to go with this tablet the specs were good but not impressive lots of chinese tablets have similar specs at a similar price the size had me really concerned i just assumed that the smaller size was more of a cost cutting method to get the price underi was dead wrong this tablet is handy and works well that means that it gets used a lot which in the end is the true measurement of value and this one stands tall,negative
63,i purchased thegigabyte version on sale fordollars without special offers thegig version wason sale without special offers what made it something i couldnt pass up was the offer of a payment plan which i agreed to and so i made the purchase having charged me thedollars the email they sent me now said i had bought the gb version i tried to cancel the purchase they said i could not i was indeed sent angig version which i could have gotten forrealizing they had just ripped me off forbucksi proceeded to dispute the sale and recover the thing i had actually bought agig version at the price id bought itand in the way id bought it on the payment plan after days of explaining and arguing with mental deficients with a certain almost laughably greedy bent i at least got what i had paid for it wasnt easy by any means and i through some amazing zeal to take from me anything they couldthey did take away the payment deal and have charged me all at once i should mention that they also took a bit of my sanity also that seemed to be the plan explaining the obvious over and over and over again to those who barely listen and comprehend less is not funnew egg will be getting more of my business whenever possible a part of me now hates amazon they took alot of my time a large part of a good deal from me and lost a friend you suck amazon and im a prime member,neutral
64,what i didnt realize about the gb was that over half of that was used up on systemoperations got these for two of my children they cant keep any more than a game or two and a movie on the device without the low storage warning coming up which it does constantly i am forever having to delete what little i can from the stupid thing so that they can use them it also kicks you off of wifi any time the storage warning comes oni currently have a kindle that i love but these little tablets are very disappointing if you are looking to purchase be smart and upgrade to the higher memory i wish i would have,negative
65,up until now i have been a confirmed kindle junkie i loved my kindle fire but right out of the box this one was slow it takes betweenandseconds every time to load my library and the carousel the back arrow button takes me out of the book not to the last location and it just now froze while i was trying to shut it down to see if that would fix the problems each of the last three kindles ive purchased the paperwhite gave it away a regular kindle sitting in a cabinet and this one have just gotten worse i dont know if this is an isolated incident or an indication of the future but i think this is my th kindle several of them were warranty replacements inyears im not going to continue spending money on these readers that dont last very long even when they are working correctlyi just now got off the phone returning this hd,negative

71,not a happy customer sideloading apps removes functionality the fire os is inferior to android os in terms of usability furthermore i am inhibited from using my google ecosystem on the fire osworst of all the kindle is pretty much a window into the shopping world of amazon and i am constantly reminded that i need to buy things rather than being able to use the tablet simply for work purposes i do not recommend,positive
72,the sheer value of this device cannot be understated i got thegb model and it doesnt feel like a single penny wastedtheinch screen is a bit small but wider than most phones of the same height and better suited for browsing reading and viewing media the clarity and colors in the screen are simply amazing for the price any other device atwould be lucky to look half as goodthe device feels a bit thicker than it maybe should be but as a result feels solid in your hand almost like a real paperback book i feel like if i dropped it it wouldnt break immediatelysometimes the software hiccups a bit but i havent noticed any significant slowdown it runs most games just finethe battery does what it promises and lives abouthours of useagain foror justfor the gb model this cant be beat,positive
73,bought for my toddler to watch netflixyoutube on trips and outings the price was phemomenal and i had it in mind to purchase a second for myself much to my chagrin this product is unacceptable for any adult with expectations of a goodgreat operating systemsturdy device solid weight but not too heavy my largest complaint is that its more useful as a remote control for amazon shopping more than anything else there is no google play store just copies of apps that you would commonly find the freetime app for kids is more annoying and obtrusive what is the point of a kids app that isnt intuitive for children who can not yet read and the bargain basement versions of apps crash more frequently than cellphone and other tablet versions its stylish has some interesting features email docs directly to the fire but in my opinion too much of the os is devoted to continued shopping on amazon even when you payaddl dollars to turn the screensaver adds off,neutral
74,for a first tablet this works perfectly for mei purchased this for one reason to be able to read ebooks in bed where its warm i have not been fond of reading stuff on the screen of my pc so i wasnt all that certain the fire would work for me but it works wonderfully i have already spent hours reading on it i have had the fire for about two weeks the fact that i can also watch nba games on this device and the picture is hd clear is a fabulous bit of icing on my cakethe camera seems to work just fine i discovered the selfie viewholy cats when did my nose get this big i can transfer photos to my pc easily not the nose one i had forgotten about the videotaking capacity and today was horrified to discover that id recorded a second video when i first got the fire which was the quintessential old person with new technology show including frighteningly clear mumbled narration so that works the deletion function works really well toofor people who are technologically adept yeah i cant tell you what you want to know about this devicebut even considering how low my expectations were for any ebook reader i am exceedingly delighted with my new toy,positive
75,i purchased this small kindle fire as a supplemental ereader for when i was too lazy to use my surfacehowever after playing with this adorable little tablet i am pleasantly surprised at just how capable it iswhile the device looks a little chunky the weight feels appropriate in the hand and is distributed evenly across the device the screen while onlyinches across is absolutely stunning for watching movies the userinterface is what you can expect from amazons proprietary forked android software but unlike previous iterations of the kindle fire the transitions seem much smoother and allaround zippierthe speaker on this tablet is not the best nor is it the worst if i had to draw a comparison it is probably onpar with many highend tablets fromthat were quadruple the price appstore selection is okay and you still have the option of sideloading android apks onto the device if the appstore doesnt have themfor the price you pay you are getting a hardworking bundle of fun that literally fits into your pocket amazon did a great job designing this device,neutral
76,i love this little guy hes got the display witch is amazing theres really no pixels that can been seen on the screen the battery life is ok good for adollar tablet the fire os is great too i had an hdx and i love it but i needed something more portable for reading and this fit the bill i wouldbuy this if you love kindled than youll love this little guy edit hey guys i also forgot to addthe speaker part of the review there are so much better than my hdxthey have better sound overall but the hdx s speakers always sucked not a surprise but overall everything on this tablet is just flipping awesome os firethe speakers the display the new and improved silk browser just everything this tablet is worth so much more thandollars buy thethough theonly has gb of actual user storage so not much storage for anything really at least with the gb you get gb of user storage,positive
77,i cannot tell you how much i love the kindle fire hdthe clarity of the screen is extremely impressive for as small as it is that part surpassed all my expectations it has convenient volume buttons on the side and from what i can tell the speaker quality is pretty good for something so tiny it fits perfectly in my purse so i can take it anywhere with me and it is on the light side so it doesnt weigh my bag downmy all time favorite feature on this is the goodreads button i have been saying for a few years now how much easier it would be if ereaders synced right up to goodreads and it finally happened instead of logging onto goodreads to update my progress or to add a new book to my currently reading shelf all i have to do is tap the screen hit the goodreads button and i can update everything from there it even tells me about how long it takes the average reader to read the book im currently on maybe its the book nerd in me but i was so excited about that feature that i literally shouted out loud in excitement when i saw itanother feature that spoke to the bibliophile in me was the related books feature as you are on the home screen scrolling through books it will show you a few other books you may be interested in purchasing based on the subject of that book i received this in exchange for an honest review and myhonest opinion is that compared to the original kindle fire with theinch screen that i already had this is by far my favorite one i highly recommend it if you are mainly using it for reading you will get over its small size rather quickly when you see the amazing features and incredible screen quality,positive
78,this has quickly become my favorite tablet i own every version of the kindle lineup from the original kindle fire right up to the hdxand hdxinch i also have an ipadand an ipad mini both of which are gathering dust because i prefer to use the kindle hdxwhich is lighter faster and easier to transfer files directly from my pc i did not expect the hdto be as good as it is but now i can’t do without it it is easy to hold and transport and fits nicely into a small bag the screen clarity is excellent wifi is faster than previous versions and the sound is much better than i expected in fact i think music sounds better on the hdthan the hdxwhich by the way is the only amazon tablet i have regretted buying i should have returned the hdx because the blue haze around the edges made the device virtually unusable comparing the hdand the hdxi would say the hdis far better in quality and less than half the price of the hdx at least when i bought the hdx last year moreover the hdhas both rear and front cameras and while i don’t use them much i find the picture capability suits my limited purposes such as scanning receipts and other documents battery life is comparable with previous versions not better or worseone other point is worth making since i haven’t heard other reviewers comment on it text on the hdis remarkably readable before i bought the fire i feared that text would too small to read on ainch screen but the software upgrades have made a huge difference reading newspapers and magazines on the fire is a real pleasure the text size automatically adjusts to the screen so that if you enlarge text you can read everything in one screen rather than seeing portions of a line as before the same thing is true with documents especially if you use the wps office on the fire i can read my word documents just as easily on ainch screen as on theonei am very happy with the fire hdthe hdxis still the king of amazon’s tablets and it has replaced my laptop when i travel the fire hdis a close second don’t hesitate to buy it you won’t be disappointed and you will be surprised how quickly it will become your preferred device,positive
79,good for travel and consuming amazon content i wanted this small fire for when i fly and want to watch tv or movies most of the content provided by the airlines is old or low quality since i have a prime account i can choose from a fair selection to load for freei was pleasantly surprised that even the good mode gives a pretty clear picturei tested it with the pilot episode of the sopranosits a good picture took just below mbi got the gb fire so i can easily fitsimilar episodes which would cover any domestic trip including airport stopsone warning video has an expiry date which for the sopranos was three daysoverall performance was goodi was impressed by the email app that came with it i found and set up my office email no problem its not thin and light rather heavynot for carrying around with you in a pocket for long times its a limited android the apps available without rooting or side loading are not extensive youtube worked wellthe biggest weakness is that it doesnt have google apps or google docs the app store is small id recommend it ifyou are a prime member andyou want it mainly to consume amazon content andyou dont need google appsbest part it is cool to be able to download for free so many videos and prime music keeping in touch with email and the officetype suite apps you can buy to view office docs i got mobisystems office suitepro and when a coworker sent me a word doc attachment to my email it opened easilyalso basic photo apps and of course books are there i use apple devices normally so it did take a day to get used to using the android style interfaceit automatically loaded my kindle books no problemwifi connectivity worked welli would actually rate thisand a half stars with half a star off for missing a broad range of android apps especially google apps,neutral
80,very disappointed i purchased my fire new a few weeks ago a couple of days after i purchased it the screen would go black while i was trying to play a game or view anything online i had to continuously restart it by pressing the power button i noticed that the problem got worse if i was hand holding it if it was laying on a flat surface it would still shut off on its own but not as frequentlyi did thesecond restart i did ittimes and the problem continued i chatted with a customer service person at the amazon site while she was very nicehelpful the problem continued basically my kindle firehd is almost impossible to use as i cant view anything for more thanseconds without it going black then switching to the recommended ads screen i tried disabling this feature thinking it might help but the problem continuesi purchased an offbrand android based inexpensive tablet for my kid and it works perfectly compared to my fire my wifes old offbrand android based tablet also works flawlesslyi really wanted to like this tablet but i am truly frustrated with it my next step will be to contact customer service yet again im seriously thinking about giving upand returning it,negative
81,i am not a computer masteri am a middle aged mom who likes to read surf the internet do some facebooking and messagingso perfect is not so important for me i see no problems or drawbacks with this producti love iti have other kindlesthis one is just a little larger than my phone and does so many things i love to dogreat size for pocketting or pursingthe portability meets my needs perfectlyloving my newest kindle,positive
82,my old tablet died this was a gift from my husband best husband ever this amazon fire hd does it all without breaking the bank everything loads instantly plays perfect without lagging is very bright clear and quick seriously worth every penny i love the kindle freetime my grandson can play without any worries thank you amazon and my darling husband,positive
83,the device is good for an adult with an account or possibly for one device shared amongst family membersunfortunately my daughter bought this with her birthday money and amazon does not have good programming options for children in a household with their own deviceso after speaking with a rep from amazon three times it has been determined that these are my three options and their flawsthe free time appis good for controlling some things like books music and some apps however it limits the child to those items onlyunder the free time app they can not take photos videos skype or any other fun apps they would enjoyparental controlsunder the parental controls you can not turn off the cloud option in booksthis allows the child to see all your books in your librarythey can swipe between the two indiscriminately this eliminates the need to choose which books you choose to download to the device as they can read all of themset up their own accountif you have prime as i do you can not share it you can share prime for shipping but not videos books etc so that membership fee looses valueif you purchase a book for your child you have to gift or loan it to themyou will also need to set up an email for the child as wellamazon is a big company and i am disappointed that they cant do this better,negative
84,oh my god i am so in love with my kindle i was so scared to clickpurchased but i did my research on youtube and read a few feedback from people who purchased the kindle and was soldits the perfect size its bigger thanmy samsung galaxy noteand smaller than your average tablet so its right in between thescreen size is perfect for reading idownload all my favorite apps its really cool,positive
85,constantly freezes and sometimes the screen does not work when i touch it it also does not turn on when fully charged every once in a while i have an ipad mini and i do not have any of these issues i exchanged it a few days after i noticed the issues but unfortunately the second one i received had the same issues,negative
86,i recently purchased myself this th generation kindle firehd device during thanksgiving as an upgrade over my st generation kindle firefirst things first you will want to get yourself a case for this as its its at a size that feels awkwardly big and small at the same time and you dont want to accidentally drop it which is easy since it also felt heavier than i would expect for something that sizehowever itll probably be difficult to find a case for this device in stores due to its unconventional sizei tried at best buy and a couple stores but eventually ordered a moko fire hdcaseslim folding cover from amazon a week later and it does the jobbuild quality wise this device feels solidit doesnt bend or feel plasticlikespeedthis thing is fast at least way faster than my old kindle wasits quick to start and very responsivereadingslightly smaller than my old kindle it will display less words per pageeasy to read just like my old kindlevideothe video on this thing is awesomehd quality and very sharpmy only complaint with the videos is that theres not enough space on the device for me to download any hd movies for offline viewingid thinkgbs would be enough but with the few movies i tried to download it complained about spacewhen i tried downloading in lower quality it workedeither i need to try a shorter movie or not download in hdas far as watching streams though its great and works flawlesslysoundim not qualified for rating sound since i have a hearing disability but when i plug in my earbuds and listen to prime music it sounds greatas far as the speakers they work and i can hear it when its turned up all the wayas far as quality of that internal speaker i think its suffice but youll probably be like me and use earbudsappsi only installed a few apps on this thing like youtube twitch spotify pocket etc and they work fine just like they would on an android devicecamerai only took one picture with the front facing camera and it was alrightfortunately my image didnt break the devicei dont intend to really take pictures with my kindle and i havent bothered taking any photos with the back facing camerafor simple photos i think its more than acquitbattery lifeso far it seems to be pretty good with battery life but has a little bit less capacity than my old kindle had but considering that this does much more stuff and last hours and hours and hours before requiring a charge im not worried at all about itabout the ads there are ads on the lock screenmeaning nothing more than that which you simply swipe to unlock thatsswipe notoryoure not forced to buy anything or click thru a bunch of surveys and i wouldnt bother paying extra to have them removedthey arent annoying or intrusive and you only see them on the lock screenif you liked an ad that you swiped past you can view them under offers in the menushoppingshopping on this thing is easyi purchased my case for this kindle via from this kindlei also purchased a few kindle booksthe whole experience was straight forward and easyfor those who want to set restrictions due to children etc there are settings you can set but i havent really played with themamazon prime servicelets all be honest here the kindle fire is really an amazon prime consumption device obviously if youre not utilizing amazon prime then this devices killer features will mostly be overlookedsure you can watch youtube on it but the prime service is what really makes this device rockwith a prime subscription youll have access to all sorts of music and videos that without id have a hard time justifying purchasing a kindle fire over a generic minitabletoverall im very satisfied with my kindle fire hdpurchase and it has been at my side pretty much since purchase effectively replacing my old kindleprosfast response softwarehardwarehd video playbackgreat with amazon primebuild quality feels solidaffordableconsheavier than i expectedkind of an awkward size like an oversize smart phone hard to find cases fornot enough memory to download hd movies for offline viewing at least for me,neutral
87,this is my third kindle i had the first generation then the hdthen this one i did a lot of research and comparison shopping before i bought this one i was torn i wanted something smaller than theand in this case it was the only one of any brand that was smaller than thebut the hdxwas a lot sleeker than this one this one has got some bulk to it surprising bulk for such a compact size and its boxy compared to the hdxhowever i stuck to my desire for a smaller kindle and i am not disappointed at all i love it i really like reading magazines on it for such a small screen theyve done a great job of presenting the magazine pages in a way that makes them clear and easy to read and the resolution wow i can see a huge difference between my old hdand this one this one is truly beautiful i guess some are bummed that this one doesnt have the mayday function on it but that has never appealed to me a chat session or email is just fine with me this one has turned out to be everything i wanted and has surpassed my expectations in many ways well done amazon once again,positive
88,warning does not support google anything i even tried getting the apks to do it myself but it wont support half of those either i didnt really do my research on this because i didnt really care that much but for anyone else if you dont like any apps associated with google then this would be ok for you but there are other tablets out there that would still be better this is essentially a glorified kindle which would be fine but its not really advertised that way,positive
89,i purchased this tablet for myyear old son as a substitute for the ipad he favored i thought this would be a good buy given that you can place more restrictions on it than the ipad and with three kindle free time it seemed more kid friendly we have been using the tablet for a month now and i have to say i am very disappointed to start the memory on the kindle is crap every app game book pretty much everything has to be downloaded to work it states that the device hasgb of memory but my kindle is currently at gb used and says to only have mb left that doesnt add up to gb its frustrating since you have to constantly delete items in order to connect to wifi and use the tablet then when you go to delete items the majority of the apps taking up space are all system applications that you cannot delete and honestly dont even use it would be nice to delete those preloaded apps to get more space for the apps you want it would be better if you could add an sd card or some type of external storage device to add more space but you cant i am getting ready to send this back and purchase the ipad at least the internal storage space can handle all of the downloads needed,positive
90,i love this kindle i have bought a bunch of tablets including the st generation asus transformer ipadsamsung tabnexusiii and this one this is cheapest one in my army of tablets but surprisingly it might be the most powerful one its wifi is so good that i can watch hd prime video at every corner of my house i purchase it mainly for my kids my daughter loves it and always calls it little ipad and said the little is better than the big ipad i dont think amazon is making good money from thegadget it should be a trap to steal your bucks when you use it to buy books audiovideo contents i have been prime member for years even we can watch so many videos for free i still bought a couple of movies for my kids anyway it is a good buy especially for young members of my family,positive
91,i bought my daughter the kindle fire for her birthday and a week later it no longer worksit just keeps turning on and off i cant even reboot the kindle because it doesnt stay on long enough to reboot itvery disappointed because i was going to purchase a kindle for myself but id rather pay extra money for something more reliable,negative
92,i have an older kindle fire and i was looking forward to an update unfortunately the one i got wouldnt ever connect to wifi so i couldnt even make it through setup amazon wasnt helpful and didnt offer to replace it with another unit so back it goes it might be a good product but sadly i will never know,positive
93,this tablet is perfect for mei like to take photos and share them via emaili trust amazon products and the new fire hd tablet is exactly what i needed as i dont want to payor more per month for a cell phone with a costly planand i dont have to use my old camera and then download the pics to my pc anymoreall the photos i take on my fire hd tablet get stored in the amazon cloudno more photo albumsi can send the photos directly from the fire tablet to my family and friends via emailand the fire hd is a great price and takes great photoseverything you need to change the photo comes with the tablet you can adjust crop rotate the photos etc and its easy to use,positive
94,perfect size and weight for travel for watching and reading in bed at night excellent video and audio quality very userfriendly and easy to set up apps nice reading quality with builtin tools that are interesting and fun to use a quick dictionary for example just by highlight a word with your finger or highlighting simply by dragging your finger down the text i love it plus forgive me but its really cute i love the size,positive
95,a little background information about me ive never owned a tablet though at one point i borrowed a friends nd edition ipad and that was a joy to use i have an iphoneand recently the newandplus came out i love my phone and i love the size of my phone and how easily it fits in my hand i use my phone for everything including my nightlyhour reading sessions the reading sessions on theinch screen of my iphone are especially painful for me so i was debating about upgrading to theplus and finally being able to read on a decent sized screen however besides reading i didnt want a bigger phone i really like my phone the way it is but the reading was difficult what to doand then enter the fire hdi am so happy i immediately drove down to my local big electronic store the day it came out they had some in stock but they werent even out on display they kept trying to sell me the older editions haha but i waited an hour or so while they found one still in the back apparently it hadnt made its way to the floor yet now i dont have to upgrade my phone to read and im so pleasedmy thoughts on the fire hd thesize feels just right to me i read a lot of fanfiction nerdy and i just go to the website in the silk browser tap on the reader mode button and scroll down as i read the device is small enough that i can easily grip it in one hand and use my other hand to lazily scroll down the page as i read its visually beautiful everything looks so clear and vivid during my two days with it so far and the os is simple and easy to navigate ive never had an android device and i wasnt looking to replace my cellphone and this is my first tablet so so far i feel like all the apps ive wanted were in the app store unless youre looking for smaller ones i dont think youll have any issues with the amazon apps i dont know if this is unique to the fire or unique to android but when i plugged the usb in to charge to my computer fire hd immediately told me this was a slow charging port and it would take awhile to charge wow ive never had a device tell me that i switched to a wall outlet and it charged perfectly finea couple of negatives i feel like it picks up fingerprints easier than some of my other devices but theyre easy enough to wipe of and no chromecast support this is actually huge for me because it means i still need my iphone to direct my tv i have a chromecast stick and a roku stick and i generally prefer to use the chromecast since it can also cast from my pc which is nice however when i am in the plex app or the netflix app it only seems to be able to cast to the roku player it does cast to the roku fantastically though so i am happy for that but the no chromecast thing means that this device cannot be a living room hero for me i would have loved to be able to retire my phone to the charger while i was home but it looks like ill still need it to control the tv however i dont think this issue will affect most people but it effects me so i took a staranother thing to note is the speaker location which is on the back of the device instead of the bottom it is true that with certain hand positions youre actually blocking the sound but i actually love the speaker placement when watching a video in landscape if youre holding the device with both hands my hands naturally make a sort of cupping hold around it just my natural handplacement which actually amplies the sound towards mei dont feel like the touch screen is quite as on point as my phone sometimes i need to click something a couple of times to make it do what i want but overall everything is so fluid i got so much more out of this then i expected for such a cheap device,positive
96,this has been one of the best investments i have made for quite a while it does everything my wifes kindle fire does and more plus it wasthe price i couldnt be happier the speed that it operates is much more than my smart phone this is a must have for all you who have been wanting a tablet that does it all without the high pricei have only had it for a week and i am still excited,positive
97,really disappointed initially thought i could live with the quirks because the price was rightmy fire locks up all the time essentially whenever it finishes a download or gets unplugged it has to be completely shut down and restarted to get out of the blank screenfire takes forever to download ordered items as compared to other servicestouch screen tech is sup par what prompted me to write this review was this morning after banging away with my fingerortimes on a link finally saying forget it and going to my lap topit was just then that i realizes that the quirks are bad enough to have me too frustrated to even try using it no matter what the price it was not worth it,negative
98,if you are expectinggig of storage for the kindle fire hdyou will be sad to know there is onlyavailable to user read the fine printvery disappointed with amazon and will not be buying from them again,neutral
99,i love the size i love the feel i hate i can not load google services i live by google apps gooe keep google drive google docs google hang outsi got the fire hd because ive been waiting on atable that could play between my phone and tablet i was prepared to buy aphone to use as a tablet i was excited when amazon release t h e hd i was very disappointed when i found out that the services i use the most couldnt load on a different type of android tablet i can load google services on any apple device but not an amazon tableti understand how amazon wants people in their eco system the problem is that eco system is incomplete without google services samsung has its own eco system and software over lay on android and still allows google servicesamazon is a great place to shop online your tablets and even the fire phone is a great way to give people access to the amazon market place and with amazon prime as a service amazon is growing stronger as a brand each day it doesnt need to block out google services to stand out as a brand,neutral
100,i discovered it is near impossible to delink the kindle fire from my primary amazon account i worry the scenario a criminal gets ahold of my kindle fire and goes on an amazon shopping binge at my expense or my yearold inadvertently goes on an app buying binge already happenedi plan to destroy the kindle fire tomorrowamazon im very disappointedup till now i was a happy amazon user wasted,negative
101,i have owned other kindles in the past but this one is by far my favorite i really love the forward and rear facing camera because it comes in handy i have thegig and have overpicturesgames andbooks loaded on my kindle with room left i often cycle out stuff using the free cloud storage and it helps extend my storage i have had no issues with the kindle and i have owned two of them since february and april compact yet well worth the money i have to agree with kindle on the fact its the best tablet for the price my only complaint is i wish it came in other colors and the battery tends to die fast when im switching between apps and games otherwise for the price im very impressed,positive
102,we bought two of these for christmas for our boysmy wife has a kindle firetablet and i think the kindle free time is the by far the best mechanism for allowing kids to use tablets in a safe waynothing ive seen even comes closeapple and android have parental controls but neither of them allow the granularity and control of freetimemy plan was to set each one up with their own kindle and free time profilefirst as for the fire hdthe fit and finish is just what i expected from a kindleit feels nice well put together a good finish on the exterior and i think the kindle os is the simplest interface for any tabletipads have a more premium feel but i think the kindle is a very enjoyable devicei was surprised at how underpowered thefeltmy wifes previouskindle is snappy and enjoyable but these neware slow to respondclick nothing click nothing click respondthe size is perfect i dont like the very large phones but as a small tablet i love this size it works good for books apps surfing and typing as good as on screen typing is which is not saying muchim hoping that an os update or similar software fix will help the response time as is the kids dont seem to mind but i would return it if this was for memy other big beef is the freetime appits really more that an app its well integrated in the the tablet and as i mentioned its head and shoulders above any otherwhen we had just onefire i never had any problemsonce we bought theweve had nothing but problemsthe time limits dont engage the schedules dont engage instead ofminutes the allowhours thenthe next day its locked out even when the schedule should let them playthe boys get frustrated my wife gets frustrated and as the it guy i get frustratedive reset the time schedules over and over again only to have it revert the next daythis fortunately is a bug and so im confidant that amazon will fix it but if i used this at a friends house i would wait to get onelastly more of a wish than a legit complaintwe are big into amazon we have the three kindles a fire tv and echo prime and cloud storagelots of this has a freetime element but amazon doesnt have a central profile management systemthey do allow you add and remove kids centrally from the site but you cant centrally control times apps and schedules and usage isnt centrally tracked so it doesnt take long for the kids to figure out that once they are out of time on one device they can just hop to the next and every time you add a new device you have to configure it and if you add a new app or change something in one or more of the kids profiles you have to go to each device and do the work over and over againamazon please connect these so we can use all your devices to the greatest extant possible,positive
103,this tablet is awesome the fire osis very intuitive to use and it looks great the fire hd is a little thicker than other tablets on the market but it just makes it feel solid it came in a very attractive box was easy to set up and is quite fast i am able to switch between apps and the internet almost instantly and it doesnt feel like it is slowing down at all even though the app store is somewhat lacking compared to google play i still have all of the popular apps i use every day such as facebook and evernote the screen is responsive to the touch and is very bright it currently lacks an automatic brightness feature so i hope that one will be added in a future edition i am also pleased that almost every app seems to be integrated with the fire os system so they all work together i am looking forward to diving deeper into the features this tablet has in the coming days,positive
104,love my new kindle i had to replace myhdx fire from dropping and the screen cracking down the center and it only worked on one side at first thewas a bit small so it took some time to get used to now i love it i use my kindle mostly to read books and sometimes check email and very little internet usage since i have an ipad air for that stuff my ipad is way to big to use for reading in my opinion anyway the internet is fine i have wifi at home but is a bit slow and laggy on thesometimes it is slow to react to a touch command but like i said im usually only reading on it so it doesnt really bother me one thing that i hate about it is the battery seems to have a very short charge to charge life i try to keep it on airplane mode most of the time so it helps i love that it has the night time blue screen setting if i want to use it i usually have it one the black screen at night when reading so i dont normally use it i also wish it had an auto dimming option like mydid that is the one thing i truly miss also in my opinion you just cant have a kindle fire of any size without the auto sleep covers they are awesome at saving some battery life and you can find them very cheap on amazon,negative
105,not impressed with it at allseems it was released way to early do to the fact it is not compatible with a lot of apps even ones that are advertized on the screen pictures and other advertizements,positive
106,the new fire hdgives very good performance even if you ignore itsprice one funny thing though mine came set to simplified chinese googles translate page got me passed that problem once i could see that languagekeyboard would look like <U+8BED><U+8A00><U+548C><U+952E><U+76D8>one novel feature is the full screen mode like you would get on ios devices most android tablets have either physical buttons or on screen buttons that never go away with kindle fire hdx amazon managed to reduce that to a small tab and only amazons own apps would it go into full screen mode now we have the same clean look that ipad and iphone has and you can bring the buttons back into view with a swipe from the top or the right of the screen,neutral
107,my husband got me the kindle fire hd for our st anniversary it was a surprise to me i found the size to be just right making it a lot easier to carry it around then my other kindle that got stolen aboutyears ago i loved that my daughter who ordered the kindle fire hd for my husbandhad a choice of what color they could get me they knew i love blue so thats what i received it has so many more apps to choose from i find itvery easy to operate and to charge it if i have trouble understanding the directions how to do something on my kindle fire theres help available to me on my kindle or on amazon love that i can get on amazon account and order my books music or whatever i want and you down loaded directly onto my kindle fire hd and i must say you have a lot of things to offer too i absolutely loved i was able to retrieve every book and songs that i had ordered off of my amazon account for my old kindle fire that got stolen and put it on my new kindle fire hd i never thought i be able to do that i had told myself whenever it was stolen that all my information was lost with that kindle that id have to start all over when i was able to buy myself a new kindle fire you wouldnt believe how wonderful that made my anniversary day even more fantastic then what it was already the displays on my new kindle fire hd are very colorfulclear i also love that it has the lite up screen because i like to read at night whenever im unable to sleep my husband however loves to sleep in cave like darkness and having the lite up screen makes it possible for me to read even with him sleeping right next to me thank you to amazon for offering such a amazing product i love my kindle fire hd,positive
108,wow i this is the slowest tablet ive ever hadtruthfully i would highly discourage anyone from buying itthe main reason is the speed of the devicei have an old fire tablet and so i thought that i would upgrade to this one and test it out to see if i wanted to purchase more of these for family and friendswhat ive found is something that is extremely slow and filled with a large number of apps that are annoying and challenging to get rid ofso if you want to surf the web buy something elseif you want to run any kind of game apps buy something else heck if you want to even buy stuff off of amazon buy something else i certainly wont be buying more of theseive given it a month and this is not worth it,negative
109,i resisted getting a kindle for years nowi swore id never go to the dark side and get an electronic reading machinehowever i booked a three week trip to new zealand and i had no room for my beloved booksoh what to do what to dofinally i had to break down and buy the demon machinespeed forward to dayof the vacation and i love love love my beautiful kindlei dont know why i resisted so longits the perfect size and much smaller than the earlier versionsill be eating crow over this purchase for months but it will be totally worth it,neutral
110,expected betterslow and hard to readi have other kindles and love them but this one is not my favoriteshould have waited for reviewsbefore purchasing,neutral
111,i bought this device as a birthday present for my daughter the major selling points were the camera and the parental controls — my daughter loves to read and play games and having a system that requires the former before the latter will get her to read and learn even moresetup for my account and hers was a little bit more time consuming than expected but went relatively smoothly we downloaded our first book and some apps established some amazon gift cards as a payment solution and set up the incentive system above under my daughters profile we got the unit yesterday and my daughter had doneminutes of reading before i woke up this morning so im very pleased with the resulti would have given this a four or fivestar review on that basis however we discovered this morning that my daughter cannot access the camera from her profile there is an explicit lineitem for camera access in parental controls which is switched to unblocked but it doesnt make a difference its completely absent from her profilei spent a lot of time trying to figure this out before calling tech support but wasnt able to get resolution from them eitheri have developed a shortterm workaround where i have downloaded a camera application which i can enable my daughter to access through her profile however its not as good as the onboard interface for the camera in addition because its now classified as an application it is included in the parental control time limits which i set up for her account that means that once shes used up her time on applications for the day she can no longer use the camerai am otherwise very pleased with the unit but not having a good camera on board because of a software bug is annoying im waiting to hear back from technical support on this issue — they promised a response in a few days if this issue is resolved in a satisfactory manner i will be amending this review if not ill be sadly returning the unit,neutral
112,have had this for about a week now and wanted to wait to give my reviewi have really mixed feelings about this device while i love the price the size and the construction i feel there isnt a whole lot on here for mewhile others who are invested heavy into the amazon ecosystem with music prime shows books etc i think this is a hit for surehowever i am not heavily vested into amazon so besides this thing being a music playernetflix viewer web browser there isnt a whole lot i personally can do with ityes amazons app store has many apps and games but its light years behind googles play store with games that are new and upcoming the lack of apps in amazons store really made the experience tainted for me and while that would be my own fault for not researching well enough before buying its not a big deal itsand its still a really cool gadgetthe speed is amazing forthis blows anytablet out of the water as far as performance the screen looks great and the battery holds pretty well so farit does feel very solid and thesize is perfect for watching netflixbrowsing the web in bedi cant knock amazon for what they are doing i just feel like they are restricting the capabilities of the device by limiting the amount of appsgames that can be installed from their storeyes you can install other apps by sideloading but the few ive tried have caused issuesive filled this up with my music netflix and pandora to have with me when i travel and for theprice i am very content with that and also being able to browse the web at my leisurejust a heads up to those who didnt do much research on the amazon store there are no google play apps available for this device and you cannot sideload them without issues arisingso if you were wanting to load up your google play music library on here you can forget itotherwise the device itself is absolutely worth theand i think i will keep it i just wish amazon would take the tight leash off of their os and allow some others to use the device how they prefer and not how amazon intends it to bebottom lineif you are a prime member love the amazon ecosystem and dont mind the not so great app selectionits a no brainerif you are wanting an android tablet with the capabilities of rooting modifying customizing etcthis wont be for you,positive
113,ill be honest i came into this relationship with very low expectationsive owned both an ipadand ipad mini retina in the past but decided with my purchase of an iphone s that i could live without a tabletive owned a number of traditional kindles and currently love my kindle paperwhiteso im definitely not an if its not apple it sucks kind of persondue to some needs i want to read during my lunch break i decided to give a fire hd a try because i needed a second kindle and quite honestly i was curious to give the color kindles a tryso ive been using it for a little more than a monthheres the good and the badthe good lets face it this thing is cheapi paid aboutfor a refurbished and evensomething for the fresh version seems like a pretty good deali like the size its a little bigger than my iphone s and its easy to hold and mount on my dash i typically use this in my car while i eat my lunch under a treeit is way thicker and heftier than my paperwhite or any of my ipadsbut thats okay im not consumed by thickness so i view it as no biggiethe overall fit and finish is pretty good especially for a fifty dollar itemi really like the kindle app and how it reads out loudthey removed this from the paperwhite and i really get a lot of use out of thisit can be simulated on the iphone with siri but honestly amazons reading is betterthe speakers are loud enoughoverall the performance of the cpu has been fine ive used it to view amazon videos and do a couple of quick internet surfing sessions and have no concernscomes loaded with all the requisite amazon apps and ive snagged a few more from the amazon app storeoverall i find their fire os to be very usableive used android a bunch and its pretty much the samehavent used the cameras so i cant commentthe bad overall not a fan of micro usb for chargingsure its picking a nit but the plug seems flimsy and im certain that im stuffing it in backwardsthis isnt amazons fault per sebut once youve experience lightning or usbc everything else seems jankyi also have no luck charging this fire with anything but its own power adapteri have a poweredport dedicated charger at my desk that i use to charge everything else iphones ipads other kindles bluetooth headphonesbut this kindle fire doesnt charge off itmakes no sense to menow the specific gripesbattery lifethis thing tears through the batterybut not while using an app but when its sitting idlei can spend my lunch hour watching an amazon video and the battery drops maybe i like thatand then i set it on my desk and come back the next day and the otheris goneleave it over the weekend and its dead on mondayand i mean dead not usable until it charges for a couple of hoursmy other big problem is the wifi connectivity is very weirdwhen im in the car i dont have it connected to any networkwhen i return either to my office or home the device should connect to either of the wifi networksinstead it cant find themif i slide to forget the network it still doesnt scan for any new onesits literally a dead serviceturning wifi off then on results in the same thingno wifi networks found my only reliable solution is to restart the device after boot up its happily connected to the wifi network thatminutes ago was out of range and unable to connective attempted to contact amazon and honestly theyve been unresponsive about my concernsfori wouldnt expect red carpet service and ive kind of figured out the flaws and can make things work if i hold my mouth just rightnot ideal but thats just the way it is i guessi suspect ill just go back to using my phone in a while once im ready to put the fire on a shelf to gather dustoh wellupdateafter returning to work after the weekend having forgot to plug the kindle fire in it was as usual deadhowever it appears that todays death is real as its been plugged into the charger for going onhours and no responseholding down the power button does nothingso its dead jimgoing to attempt to contact amazon ideally for a refundthis is not something i want to mess withand id recommend the samesave your moneyits just not worth the hassle,neutral
114,the video quality is of a much noticeably lower quality than the fire hdxthis one does have front and rear cameras which is nice but we were more interested in the video quality reading kindle books and apps than we were concerned with taking pictures with itit is fast but not as fast as the fire hdxspend a little more money and opt for the fire hdxfor a better quality movie viewing experiencethe power button is on top and volume controls on the side rather than the back on the fire hdxwhich is nicealso it is completely square rather than tapered off on the back at an angle like the hdxwhich is nice and makes it easier to adjust volume and power offspeaker quality is a little less than hdxbecause it is in mono rather than stereo formatbut it isnt that noticeable,positive

118,an excellent tablet for a great priceits fast has great graphics is wonderful for watching movies on amazon prime netflix or hbogo and has good games and appsit easily connected to my wifi but works fine when im out of rangethe size is finei expected ascreen to be a bit small but it is niceit fits easily into my back pocket or coat pocket when im outaboutive used a nexusand th generation ipad so the amazon gui took a bit of getting used to but after a week im on to it and can navigate just fineim still working on integrating my google existence but thats not a big issueyes it is set up to ease amazon purchases especially apps music videos and books but spending is not at all mandatory to use this tablet to its fully capacitythere are plenty of free apps booksmusicthe speaker is good and loud enough to listen to music or a movie whilst making diner in a noisy kitchenthe special offers are app and book ads on the initial splash screenonce you swipe to unlock there are no more offersthe actual book reading feature is good although i sill prefer my paper white at night or in sunnyglare conditionsnevertheless id highly recommend,positive
119,i bought two of these as christmas gifts for my almost andyear oldsboth of their ipod touches were getting older and they had asked for replacementsi thought the bigger sized tablets would be a welcome replacementi also wanted to utilize the prime video and music i already pay forimagine my surprise when i tried to set up the household profiles which is widely advertised as the best thing evathis advertised feature was what helped me decide on these devices vs an android tablet to quote directly from the kindle hd product page with profiles create unique profiles for up toadults andchildren so family members can share a tablet and still keep personalized settings like email and social accounts home screen carousel and even their own level in games like angry birds my plan was to set up a kid profile for each child so they could each enjoy their own device nowhere in all the reading i did on amazoncom was there any discussion of what features are turned off for the child profilesheres the real deal the children profiles are locked down tighter than ft knoxthere is no email no access to social networks no music and no browser for a child profileonly videos books and appsthis probably is a great fit for ageand under ironically the age range for freetime unlimitedfor myyear olds though a child profile would be a huge step backwards from the functionality they enjoyed with their ipod touches no music reallythe other big drawback to the child profiles is they literally cannot pull down any of their own contentit is left to me the adult to select what they have access toat the individual book or app levelthat makes sense for ayear old but not an option that interests this busy mom with two internetsavvy childrenso what does that leavenot muchafter fighting with their kid profiles including a teen setting that only seems to allow the user to change from landscape to portrait orientation i deleted themi have two devices two kids and only one other adult profile available on my prime accountso im left with just one choicehave both devices use the main prime accountthis gives both devices access to the music and the ability for the user to pull down their own content this also means we myself and my two kids are all sharing the same library not a huge deal but if i have any books or videos in my library that i dont want them to read im going to have to manage that myselfso much for all these wonderful family controls if i had only one device i might add the second adult profile and call it a daybut i have two devices not onethe kids love their devicesthey were able to get up and running very quicklyi turned off click purchases for each device and added a pin for video purchases which i believe will limit the damage they could do one of them did buy an app yesterday without realizing it i need to dig in and figure out what happened therewhat amazon needs for the kindle hd is another profile option for familiesi would love to see a teen profile that looks more like the adult tablet settings with email music and social network accessi am bummed that i cant take advantage of the screen time controls that is a nice feature of the kid profiles that i cant use because of the other limitationsin the meantime amazon should do a better job of explaining what isnt available with the child profilesmost of my frustration comes from the sense of being oversold the wonderful world of amazon freetime and family profilesonce i figured out that it wasnt a good fit for my family i was left with very little functionality to manage my kids devicesedited to add a friend who is wrestling with this same issue shared her discovery that adding the second adult profile to the prime account does not grant access to prime video or musicapparently you can share books only via the family librarythis makes the above quote from the hd product page even more misleadingthis is different than sharing the prime accountaccording to the help page it only grants the shipping to up to four household members free or paid amazon prime members can share their shipping benefits with up to four additional family members living in the same household if you purchase a prime membership for a small business you may invite up to four coworkers to shop with this corporate account other amazon prime membership benefits such as prime instant video prime music and the kindle owners lending library cant be shared,positive

129,i had never used a tablet before i got my kindle fire when i started using it i was amazed this tablet has made my life so much easier and more convenient this tablet has so many great features it is very lightweight and slim so much better than lugging around a laptop the display is so crisp and bright and video and gamequality is excellent the kindle has anhour battery life and easy to use wifi ability it has silk browser which is really fast in fact everything on the tablet is very fast there is a front and rear camerawhich makes it really easy to take photos or selfies with just a touch of your finger once youve taken these great quality pictures you can edit them right there on your kindle you have your choice of a bunch of great colors i chose cobalt and it is really pretty the tablet comes with the amazon app store kindle book store prime music and much more so you can buy all the apps games music and ebooks that you want the tablet comes with its own memory but if you fill it you have free access to cloud storage which you can access from any device or computerthe tablet comes with dolby audio and a built in microphoneif you are a amazon prime member like i am you can download free movies and tv shows to your kindle to watch later like on vacation the tablet makes it easy to access your email with a touch of your finger and never have to go sign in to a website the same goes for any other websites that have an app like facebook pinterest amazon and ebay the kindle interface is so easy to use with a touchscreen you can access anything you need easily and quickly your kindle provides you with a quick swipe carousel of frequently used apps and books one of the best things about this kindle is that it is so durable and strong i am a bit of a klutz and have dropped my kindle numerous times so its so important to me that my device can withstand these kind of accidents this kindle has gone above and beyond this standard with no issues i love my kindle i use it all the time and i barely ever use my laptop and pc anymore not to mention my smart phone the kindle can do everything my smartphone does but on a bigger screenit travels so easily and is so convenient i would highly recommend this kindle firei received this product for free for my honest review,positive
130,wasnt sure about buying thehd or the newfire im in my fifties and was concerned about the smaller screen but after reading reviews on the newfires and the consistent complaints about touch screen hanging and stuck pixels i decided to opt out of the new fire then i realized that my kindle keyboard has ascreen ive used the heck out of that one so i took the chance on this fire hd very happy i did so the unit responds with crispness the text to speech works well i always have liked the readability mode on silk my arm doesnt get as tired holding this little guy as it did with my st generation fire the second reason i picked thehd is because we have a desktop and laptop at the house this kindle can be easily taken with me the email apps are much more improved even with finicky gmail videos are clear the sound is good also i put the unit flat on the kitchen counter when making dinner and played a podcast heard it just fine with volumethe way up i know my hearing isnt what it once was,neutral

140,im giving this product two stars because i enjoyed using it while it was working it died yesterday a little over a year after i bought it it was inexpensive enough that im not going to cry about it too much but i would have expected to get at least two years out of it i have had other tablets that lasted so long that i felt guilty about wanting to upgrade to a newer model because they were still going strong,negative

144,i love my new fireits the perfect size and i love watch my movies and tv shows on it i use to be a nook girli wouldnt by anything unless barnes and noble made itthen i meet a few people who had kindles and complained that the could not watch nor read unless they had internet service i thought that was crazy once you purchased an item it was yours i was really loving my nooks after thatthen one day my sisters friend asked if i could help her how to use her kindle i explained i had nerver seen nor used one but would try when i picked up her kindle hd fireinch i feel in love the first thing was the design next was how easy it was to use but the main thing i caught was that you can watch or read from it if you down lowed your items i never went nook again i gave two away and kept my newest one now i have three kindles fire hdin fire hdxinch and now the fire hdmy favorite i do have a weakness for small electronics,neutral
145,this hdreplaces a fire hdxwhich i have owned for a few years and is still mostly functional but is delaminating screen and case separatingi still beleve the fire tablets are by far the best ereaders on the market considering price text display quality and overall ergonomics the hdfits in the hand slightly better than the hdxand at this point is probably ideal the backlight and text quality are excellent and the paging is quicknow for the less than excellent sound quality was mediocre with a good pair of bose overear headphones their were perceptible decompression artifacts at high frequencies these artifacts tend to show up as small cymbal crashes sounding more like hiss than an actual cymbal its possible this was actually a result of the audio compression process and not the hd but i doubt it if you primarily listen to human speech you will never notice thisanother issue is heat if you play games on this device be prepared for the back of the device to get almost uncomfortably warm this does not happen when just reading textone last point why no microsd card slot the hdhas only modest quantities of memory available while less capable models do have this feature allowing for much greater memory capacity,neutral
146,im a mac guy that said i dont or more accurately am incapable of comparing anything to apple especially tablets but im going to try give it my honest call for the hdok first lets throw the price out the window that alone is an embarrassment to every tablet including the ipad minionly mini being glued together out there yeah i know you price boys are laughing and guess what most of us who have an hd are laughing harder my suggestion to those snickering is to get one forget the steak for dinner one night and order the hd youll love it techs are out there and will mean everything when you use one quicker and louder in a good way than my ipad airused more than my surface and if my airpro didnt have endless gigs id use it always ok it creaks a little my only neg along with girth but i cant put my ipads in my jacket to hit the road my real question is why dont other tablets have a real external speaker when a seventy dollar tablet can best an ipad air with one speaker internally thehd beats all i mean all tablets visuals are are not only acceptable but imperceptible from ipad to hdwell unless thats your thing ok numbers are one thing reality cmon ok im out love my hd,negative
147,replaced a previous generation hdwith this hdi wish they had an hdoption but it was either an hdor hdthe price was nicehave had a it a month and a halfso far so goodscreen layout is different and a bit more annoying than the older simpler carrousel screen version but i spent some time deleting what i did not like to simplifyit seems a bit heavier than the older modelsoverall i like itfor the price it is a nice little tablet with a great screen that lets me watch tvmovies facebook email play games such as words with friends read etci do prefer my kindle paperwhite for reading paperwhite has better antiglare screen settings etc specific to reading comfort but this tablet works in a pinchthis hdis a great device to travel with to have everything you need in one small handy package,positive
148,debating on a return silk browser is useless and no other browsers are available customer service sent me an app page that lists other browsers but none of them show up on the fire tablet when you try to purchase cant download browsers even when you change settings to allow outside content cant use freegames without changing privacy settings to allow tracking the underground feature is the exact opposite you allow tracking or whatever the game developer wants to get the free apps or offers could not use even one free offer upon receiving my new fire the screen display is chopped off around the edges and with the last automatic updates for silk and facebook only got worse i saw some customers posted they went back to old kindles as i have done old kindle allows more privacy allows maxthon browser the screen when i compare side by side shows old kindle to have larger screen edge to edge icons are larger and more visible on old kindle the advertisement picture for fire hd depicts an entirely different screen than what actually shows up on the device i only bought it because the old kindle has nearly reached capacity for storage even after removing to the cloud and adjusting settings and notifications glad i kept my old kindle,negative
149,the new kindles are horrid they have so much junk pilled into them you barely have room to put anything on it yourself they are awkward to hold the speaker is poorly placed the new operating system is cluttered they are buggylaggythe battery life is non existent and they over heat with minimal use,negative
150,this tablet is wonderful i dont know how i iived without itactually i have stagecancer and am quite sickthis device is portable and is packed with books movies and funmy fire goes to dr appointments hospital tests and treatmentsbecausemyhospital has wifi i can facebookfriends and family for instant updates and supporti love my fireits perfecta huge thank you to the kind soul who gifted this to me for christmas,positive
151,after thinking about buying a fire and doing research for a solid year i took a deep breath and bought the fireforive had it for about a month and so far im happy with it i am not savvy when it come to technology and need things to be spelled out for me i had no problem connecting it to my wifi and everything went fine as it downloaded the updates the one problem i had was figuring out what the cloud was and that i had to download the book i was reading so i could read it offline i called amazon and the representative was great and took her time explaining things to me i mostly use it as an ereader but go on line to watch youtube or go to facebook i dont play games so i have no idea how the fire works with that but i like it a lot as an ereader its much nicer than the regular kindle ive been using for the lastyears no real problem with that either its definitely worth thewhich isless than what i paid for my yearold kindle,neutral
152,first off i was not excited to make the switch from kindle keyboard to the tablet but i made the switch for texttospeech tts reasons i was really mad that amazon seems to be dropping tts from all eink modelsmy old kindle was very buggy and texttospeech continually crashed put in perspective i used this kindle for ttshours per week while at work accountantso i was concerned the tablet would have terrible battery life that i couldnt pause tts without looking at the screen kindle keyboard would pause using space bar and that for the cheap tablet price i would be buying something cheap i was very wrongamazon bought the tts company ivona and the tts on the tablet is female but it is much better than the previous tts versionsas for battery life if you get a case that doesnt suspend your device you can start texttospeech turn off the screen and get to work on whatever else you were doing and the tts keeps running great the user interface is much better for tts on the tablet than on eink kindles and without the screen on the tts uses almost no battery life i can use tts in this way forhours straight and only burn upbattery life even with the wifi turned on im absolutely serious i charge this device maybe once or twice a week tts uses less battery on the tablet than on the kindle keyboard it doesnt glitch ever the voice is better though different gender and its been an allaround better experience on the tabletinstead of pausing with that space bar so i dont have to look down at it while working you can simply power on the screen button on top of tablet and tilt the device to rotate the screen unless you have screen rotation lock on this will automatically pause tts this works just as well as space bar only you have to look at the screen to restart and it automatically restarts the page but i found i like the restart on the tablet because it gives you a refresher on your most recent page before continuingas a tablet id say this entrylevel fire tablet is pretty good im a heavy amazon services user so amazon rewards me with a good user experience you get prime movies all my backedup music all my photos a relatively nice email that links with my gmail account and prime music with a meh rear facing speaker use headphones or bluetooth in a speaker system and the music experience is goodthe screen is bright and pretty accurate with colors but the cheaper lighting washes out at full brightness but hey its a in tablet not really intended for lots of serious movie watchingthe buttons are great because they are not on the back these are classic volume rocker on the left side power button push not slide on top and thats itanyone holding out for texttospeech on a new eink should honestly just get this if tts is your primary reading method for kindle booksreading on thescreen is pretty good but thats not what i bought this for but i must admit some reading apps like life churchs bible app are really great on the tablet and make reading a bible reading plan super easy and being able to pull up movie or amazon music content is pretty neatoh and get the gb version after the operating system is installed the gb version has really no space for any contenti have always said if amazon would put tts on a new eink keyboard i would be willing to pay big money for it up to maybebecause tts has been so useful for me but i like this tablet even more and im a hard sell on change,neutral
153,pros size allows for easy portability it feels like an actual book in your handssmooth touch screenquad core processor allows fast browsing and smooth reaction time games and apps work perfectlyfront and rear cameras quality is better than average but doesnt beat the camera of apple productsebook reader is amazing nothing else to say there is also a read only function on the browser that allows easy reading of online articles without all of the constant zooming in and outgood resolution everything is in hdthe price of courseexceeds expectations definitely better than low end tablets it beats most mid tier tablets and at a lower pricecons app store doesnt have the same range as others but that will change soonstorage space while you can use amazons cloud to store extras it gets annoying at times to have to reload something from your cloud to your devicewhile the special offers feature that comes with the tablet is a genius marketing plan it is very annoying i recommend payingextra to remove the special offers featuresound is mediocrerecommendation do not buy the fire hd as it is the same as the hd but bigger and more expensive if you are a person that uses more space i recommend upgrading to gb buy a screen protector as the touch screen attracts a lot of finger prints i recommend getting something like this as a casehave started using my fire hd over my ipad because of its size and functionalityoverall a great tablet for the price,positive
154,i love everything amazon does unfortunately the fire is the exceptionif you are buying the kindle fire to read books then proceed and purchasehowever if you are purchasing and expecting to do something as simple as play clash of clans dont buy it unless you dont mind manually installing the app then finding a way to install google play so the game can be synced with other devices i personally prefer things to be simple,negative
155,i am extremely happy with the fire hdtableti bought it to use as a sonos controller for one of the rooms and its really more then that nowit was really easy to setup maybeminutes to connect it to wifi sync my apps from my other kindle and get it up and runningthe only complaints i have is the charging port and the power button are really too close togetheralso this kindle wasn’t updated to the latest firmware before it shippedthat took abouthours to download and install all of the versions needed to get it up to the current releasethat’s really the only thing that bothered me it took a long time when one update should have sufficedother then that i really like the form factor especially when used as a remote for something,negative
156,i owned the absolute first generation of kindle fire that ever came out and until this year i kept it and used it the only problem was the battery life was kind of low and we were going to be taking a long road trip i researched and bought this kindle fire because the reviews said that the screen even though it was smaller than the inch was awesome i would have to agree it does take a little bit of getting used to the navigation because it is different than the original kindle fire from days gone by but super fast super quick and the screen resolution is awesome kindle fire continues to amaze many people say g what kind of a phone is that and i have to tell them its not a phone its a kindle and i got it for a fraction of the price that you would pay for a smartphone,neutral
157,i was worried that thesmall fire was too small but i thought the smaller fire will easy to carry yes so it has great color and the size is just greatthe only gb is tight but amazon keeps all of my apps books everything on the cloud waiting for it outso i recommend for folks like the smaller fire good jobi was having problems and had asked for a return but over this weekend i spent a lot of time with thisfire and found myself very loving it after i found more about it i have become very much in love with it so im keeping it and not get a larger fire the size is just perfect for me,positive
158,just to be clear i dont hate the fire hd and i can even deal with how amazon tries to lock the product down for the most part i hate the fact that the product comes preloaded with ads and that i had the option to pay extra not to see this i refuse to pay extra everytime i open the device im reminded that i will never purchase another amazon hardware item because of this whats sad is amazon has years and years worth of purchasing information on me and it still cant show me relevant ads find a better way to market to me,neutral
159,i love this kindle i wasnt sure if id like how small it was but i actually really love that its a smaller size kindle its very easy to hold and can fit in my purse easily im amazed how how crystal clear the photos are i made sure to use the camera so i could see how the photos turned out they turned out very well too i watch netflix a lot so i wanted to see how this would run when i watched something on netflix it was perfect it ran so great and it never stopped at all i love that it went through the entire movie without any problems they even have a lot of great apps theyve got all the normal apps that i would use of course reading on it is great as well i actually prefer this smaller screen while readingi would recommend this product to anyone its a nice looking tablet and it works great if i could give this more than five stars i wouldi received this in exchange for a review all opinions aremy own and may differ from yours,positive
160,the battery runs down quick i get abouthours of play orhours of readingand it will not continue to function when charging it either has to charge or functionif i would have known this i would not have purchased it i would have waited on a different model that would both function and continue to charge when plugged init has now been nearly two months that i have owned this fire my dog a rat terrier knocked it off of my nightstand ft high onto the hardwood floor and the screen shattered so and i copy and paste here fire hd tablets are built by amazon and engineered for everyday life our tablets undergo overdurability tests and are designed to withstand forces ofg’s when tested against ipad miniin drop tests and tumble tests fire hd proved x more durable maybe i got a defunct one but i dont think my little dog could knock it so hard to the ground with greater than g force,negative
161,the old addage you get what you pay for applies here while the tablet is extremely cheap has an excellent screen and feels sturdy it even survived a drop it lacks in content my biggest disappointment is that many popular apps are either out of date or not existent because amazon runs their own custom os on the tablet there just doesnt seem to be thirdparty support for this osnow if you have a prime or kindle subscription the tablet is excellent it has easy access to all the music purchases ive made and makes it easy to download and view movies and books using amazons services,neutral
162,purchased the kindle firethe device had a bad operating system so they replaced it the good we decided however that the screen is too small and that we did not like the operating system so we wanted to return it for the purchased priceafter being transferred topeople through amazon support chat and then i was connected and transferred topeople on phone support i was told they would not refund the purchase because they had already replaced the defective item for free the badmy advice is to decide if you like it or not before it breaksif it goes bad and they replace it youre stuck with it no matter whatit took an hour to get this extremely disappointing answer,negative
163,at first i did not love this and was going to send it back i have an ipadand felt this was way too small and why use this when i have the kindle app on my ipadhowever everything changed once i got the screen cover i could prop it up in bed and read it wo my husband complaining that it was so bright and it took up much less roomi love that i can shop the amazon store on it and browse other books which im unable to do on my ipadvery glad i gave myself time to adjust to it and kept itif you have an ipad and real alot and have the extra fundsi say go for it but give yourself an adjustment periodif you have an ipad but dont really have the extra money right now save your money its not life altering its just a little more convenient and user friendly,neutral

165,i love thefire hd at first i contemplated upgrading to thebut now that i have myi am happy with my choice it is just small enough to be manageable but large enough to feel like a tablet reading books on it is so easy and though it comes with instruction i really didnt even need them the build of it is pretty solid which is great for a clumsy person such as myself the quality of the video playback is awesome for such a compact device very impressed i did upgrade to the gb since i read quite a few books and love movies and music i received the item at a discount for reviewing purposes all opinions stated whether selfpurchased or provided for review are completely those of my own,positive
166,this is easy to navigate but my biggest complaint is the weight i have rheumatoid arthritis and it is very difficult to hold without having to frequently stop readingthe stand on the cover doesnt help because of the anglei really prefer using my original kindle with page tabs on the side if it had a built in lighti wouldstill be using itprogress sometimes isnt the answer for us all,positive
167,for an ereader and media device at the price it getsstarswhen you buy an amazon tablet you have to know that you are not getting an ipad or a high end android device or the google at app store comparing it to those is not fair unless done in the correct perspective i have an ipad airbut throwing it in my purse to take with me and read books off of is not convenient i originally purchased theamazon fire nonhd tablet it was okay but i didnt find myself wanting to use it at all so i ended up giving it awayi have been wanting to read more and needing to read from the bookshelf app for school so i sought out again to find a suitable ereader this was on woot as a daily deal for abouti couldnt pass it up gb version and was supposed to come with ads but to my surprise it did not this was a pleasant surprisethe hd screen is really nice for netflix or amazon prime videos im used to watching on my ipad but i have no complaint the visual quality of this device i watched a movie last night while working on homework and used my bose ear buds the speaker on this tablet isnt great but i dont expect it to be it has bluetooth so i can use external speakers or headphones if i want quality soundfor reading books this is the perfect size i can hold it in one hand and lay in bed or take it on the go i havent done much web browsing on it because i have so many other devices for thati am typing this review on the fire in the amazon shopping apppredictive text works quite welldont expecttop of the line experience with this tablet but at this price know that youre getting more for your money than if you buy a different type of device and youre getting the amazon brand so if you have prime this is great atablet from any other company isnt going to match up to this,positive
168,initially when i received this i had problems removing a sample that i downloaded and was about to return it the sample remained in the cloud and then after complaining it was removedso far i have used this for reading the battery lasted six hoursi purchased this due to a recommendation that it would do almost everything my laptop does and that it was small enough to fit in my pocket i am going to be travelling to another country and it is a twenty six hour trip flighti can do everything on my zte force smartphone that this does the battery is replaceable on my smartphone and lasts about four hoursthe screen on this fire hdis adequate for personal viewing while holding it and is larger than my smartphone screenreading with it is comfortable i read a posting on a travel forum that a passenger was required to turn their smartphone off and they were unable to use it during the entire flight where others had no problem using their kindles this is why i bought this as i stated my smartphone does everything this does with the addition of having replaceable batteries but of course the screen is smallerthe price was reasonablethings i would like that this tablet does not have a replaceable battery and the ability to upgrade the memory,neutral
169,i loved my kindle fire hdxi used it for overyears daily for reading mobile gaming internet email facebook flickr etcthen one day it decided to freeze permanently on the boot screen after exhausting all solutions without success i decided just to buy a new kindlemy thought process was that since the regular fire hd was on its th gen it would probably be comparable to my hdx that wasyears old at that point i hopedi am disappointedthe prosthe display is comparably the same nice hdthe constouch screen sensitivity is lesser you often have to “hard double tap” the screen to get it recognize the interaction the older hdx screen was much more responsiveprocessor speed is much slower on the yearold hdx switching between apps such as looking up a word on wikipedia while you were reading a book was seamless and almost instantaneous on this kindle there is noticeable lag usually betweenseconds that may not sound like a lot but when you are reading and you want the answer immediately so you can continue reading it is a major annoyancesound quality is barely adequate the hdx had pretty good speakers you could actually watch a movie on it and be satisfied you could use a sleepsound app on it and actually fall asleepthis kindle’s speakers sound like acheap flip phone my galaxy s has better speakers—with a case on itno automatic screen brightness adjustment you always have to adjust the screen brightness manually this is even though the device has a forward and backward facing cameraconclusion i’m going to keep using it it is adequate but it is a disappointment,neutral
170,customer care sucks i called amazon because my screen is cracked and they said it was nothing they could do about it even when i offered to pay for the replacement glass i have purchased quite a few kindles from them and this is the first that ever cracked the commercial claims that the kindle fire can take a fall like from a moving car but that is not true my kindle didnt fall from a car and it still cracked there is no vendor to service the kindle either so be careful with your kindle fire or purchase the extended warrenty because the commercial mislead you,neutral
171,i bought two of these for my kids for christmas and we cheaped out and got the gb model although the table is nice and easy to use there is no space for games for the kids they can each have betweengames at a time and we couldnt even fitlarge game injustice on my sons tablet when we completely wiped everything else the os and applications that you cant delete take up over half of the memory on this model if you want a tablet for kids this one is great if you spend more and get a model with more memory as it is these are nearly useless for us and we will be selling both of them to upgrade tolarger model,neutral
172,totally frustrated they dont tell you you cant use onboard keyboard without a stylus to enter numbers unless you have micro fingers i cant set up the wifi because my password has several numbers and the numbers on the keyboard are about th of an inch tall right above the letters so when you try to push a number you get a letter instead also without wifi you cant register so you might as well just use this as a paper weight had they said up front i needed a stylus i would have ordered one be sure you have you wifi information with you before you push the power button the first time or you will lose all the tutorialsset up helpthen your on your own they dont tell you that either the instructionsjust say charge it first then hit power keyfollow onboard instructions this is the most frustrating product i have ever purchased,neutral

174,first things firsti love my ipadnothing beats than my ipad but it doesnt fit in my purseas a result i decided to give thekindle a trywell im here to tell you that i love iti read every chance i get and i hate reading on my phone because of the small screen and it eats up the phone battery life thekindle is the perfect solution for portability purposes for more technically advance needs i use my ipad but for reading my books reading my emails and browsing the web shopping on amazonlol on the go thiskindle is perfect battery life is greatjust took a trip and the battery was still atafterhoursi travel quite a bit and this all purpose little wonder is amazingcant go wrong with amazon,neutral
175,first off this is a great tablet for the price and even better on the occasional fire sales that amazon has on iti actually prefer the smaller size because its a great bridge between too small to comfortably browse android phone and too large to carry on my personinch and above tabletsits still big enough for my small hands that i dont misclick anythingthe construction of the thing is much more solid than i thought it would beits almost built like a nintendo product in how compact and well put together it feelsany other tablet ive ever handled feels flimsy compared to thisand even when running programs it tends not to get too hotbattery life seems to get abouthours of use time per charge which is more than plenty enough for meand although im not a big mobile gamer and thus i really havent put the processor to the test any program that ive thrown at it has ran fineso a couple minor issuesone is the fact that the fire ecosystem is closed meaning that you dont have the same range of programs as normal android devicesthere are ways of sideloading programs but officially you are limited to whats on offer in the amazon app storeto counter than the amazon app store does have some pretty good deals on apps frequentlybut the app store does not have the sheer number of available programs as google play or iosand for browsers you basically have fires own silk browserit does its job but its very no frillsit also crashes occasionally when fed videosyou can get other browsers but youll have to sideload them from elsewherelastly some of the firmware updates occasionally do funky things to the oson one occasion i had frequent soft lockups when i unlocked the deviceon another occasion i had the lock screen ads open the app store in spite of me not asking for it on unlockboth of these issues were solved by either os updates or rotations in adsand they were but minor annoyances overallso foryou get a really solidly made tablet that can do most everything a tablet is want to do with no fussyoull just have to learn to live in amazons ecosystembut thats honestly not too badas a carry around browsing and app device this is definitely worth the money,positive
176,i was so excited to buy a little gift for myself before i purchased it i did some research online to make sure all of the apps i love were available in the amazon store for kindle it showed they were so i went down to best buy and bought it got home and the very first app i tried to get sims freeplay was in the amazon app store i hit purchase then sadness it said the app i chose was not compatible with this device what i tried some other appssame thing there are some apps like bingo bash that i did get that are ok but im still disappointed that i cant get sims freeplay im getting a new ipad for christmas my advice stick with apple it least you can get any app you want on all of your apple devices,neutral
177,i am typically an apple product owner as i have an iphone and a mac but i am slowly falling in love with amazon this is my first tablet by amazon and i am very impressed the packaging here is top notch i am really liking the size and weight of the tablet this is a quality product and for the small price is one of the best deals ive seen recently everything is quick and easy the lack of storage space and outside app stores i can understand might be a bit of a concern for many but for me its not a huge problem i dont store a ton of content i can live with gb if you plan on getting the fireyour better option would be the gb if you plan on downloading a substantial amount of music and apps personally some music a few apps and some books works fine for me the cloud storage makes it easy to freely store what you want at the touch of a buttonthis is certainly more of a streaming device then a tablet with a ton of storage space if youre a prime member and a frequent amazon customer then you already get access to a great deal of content so if youre not a prime member not usually an amazon shopper and youre looking for a tablet with large amounts of storage this probably wont meet your needs but if you are a prime member and are interested in streaming and storing a bit of music and apps then this is a steal amazon has shown why theyre one of the best companies around well done,neutral
178,i like this little kindle fire hdforits a great dealsince getting it ive read a book watched a movie used apps been online etcruns very smoothly with no noticeable lag timevery impressed that there was no refreshing during the moviethe only other kindle i have is an early reader so im new to this type of device from amazonim not liking the carousel is there a way to make it go awayi love love the size but think it feels heavy those are two minor complaints that are easy enough to live with thoughi am happy that i bought it and am planning on ordering a cover for it soongood job amazon,neutral
179,full disclosure im not very tech savvy i dont play any mobile games and have never used an ipad or other tablet device previously i also live in a college town and have free wifi at worki got this originally because my phones memory was entirely taken up by audiobooks i wanted something that could better store and interact with my preexisting audible accountalso i have small hands and knew that i wanted something that wouldnt be unwieldy or too heavy to carry about this is perfect it is lighter than my phone samsung galaxy s without feeling flimsy and has a matte body that is easy to grip the touch sensitivity is very good it responds to my fingernail but not any random object like i said im not tech savvyit takes less than a minute to set up and a quick tour of the tabs and youre golden my audible account synced in with my amazon info as well as kindle books movies and music previously purchased through amazonthe only negative is that while it can connect to bluetooth speakers it doesnt connect to my headphones because it doesnt have mic support their website says you can connect to any bluetooth headset without a microphone but i have never heard of a headset without a mic in any other case this would merit a loss of a star however the on board speakers are great full body sound without a hint of tinninessalso the internet browsing is great its the same quality as browsing on my phone or laptop i think a great deal of the issue people have is that you have to open the app to search as opposed to using the search widget because it will search the device first then the internet if you use the widget but otherwise it is the same as using google chrome on mobile,positive
180,i regret buying this i wish i could return it its aesthetically pleasing but there are a lot of drawbacks this is a fourth generation fire so it doesnt even recognize my wifialso if you want to stream amazon prime video content from the fire to your tv it requires a microusb to hdmi adapter pain in the tush its easy to find a microhdmi to hdmi but the microusb to hdmi is difficult the hdmi cable that works with the samsung phones does not work with the fire i spentat best buy for the rocketfish version and that didnt work eitheralthough it saysgb all the preinstalled apps take upgb so you can only store one hd movie or a couple sd moviesthe internet moves at a soso paceagain its aesthetically pleasing i get compliments on it i bought the amazon brand protective case in red and its looks great i play chess on it and read books,positive
181,the fire hd is an absolute must have for anybody children included i ended up purchasing three different tabletsone by one intended for children for myyear old to enjoy each time i would try to set it up and end up with nothing but issues so i would return and try another well after three attempts i came to amazon and purchased the fire hdand it has been the best choice i have made and this is the second i have purchased one foryr old last christmas and this one for the kindergartener this christmas the tablet isadult friendly but also turns out to be one of the best tablets for children as well it has withstood all the abuse my youngest has been able to hand out it also has the best platform called free time which is everything your child could ever want in one device free time has all the books games and videos at their fingertips but also has them in their favorite characters my sister purchased the nabi for twice the cost and she has regretted her choice fire hd will not freeze is not hard to switch between regular and kid mode another top notch amazon item,positive
182,i have had the kindle firegeneration fororyears now it still works but was getting slow to charge and no camera i got this kindle fireth generationand am in love i love the smaller size the camera is amazing to me takes better pictures then my phone it has blue shade so makes reading much easier in the sun it was easy to transfer my things from one to the other and the smaller size fits nicely in my purseive always liked kindle products as i also have a kindle paperwhite that i still use,positive
183,item worked fine with the initial charge however the screen eventually went black and could not charge item i could not get the device to turn on or respond with a hard reset my kid was extremely disappointed due to the fact he couldnt use the item on ahrmile road trip recommend another product,negative
184,i am a longtime kindle fan i love amazon i saw these kindles were coming out and decided they would be great beginning tablets for my kids overall the quality is unsatisfactory they randomly turn off the battery life is horrible even with wifi turned off the battery is dead in a day this isnt a fluke they both do this my kids are not happy with them and that sucksi really want to send them back will amazon take back thecovers i bought too,positive
185,truly disappointed with this kindle fire very poor performance it literlly tookminutes to open one book from the kindle reader app and for me that is unacceptable terrible battery life simply a poor purchase on my part and i returned it afterdays i actually traded in my st gen paperwhite and then turned around and bought the latest paperwhite,negative
186,i am so happy with this hd model however the reason that i am so happy with it is because of what i use it for obviously if you are looking to replace atablet like an ipad mini you will be somewhat dissapointed however if youre using it for its intended purposeas a supplement to save your more expensive screens when using it for extended screen time you tube videos amazon videos reading and the like it is great i use it for the above purposes and for skypemy three hour video confrences with friends which btw works flawlessly it pairs with my bluetooth keyboard so i even find it useful for emails the dedicated utube app is not as full featured as the ipad version where you can shrink the video that you are watching while perusing the various youtube menu systemsbut for actually viewing the videos it is just as goodi have had no problems with the silk browser and that browser works as well for me as any ipad browser that i have used be careful however of downloading amazon apps that seem to want the user to agree to giving up useage details and what have you for the right to use their free apps and speaking of which my apple ipad just has more advanced apps for what i need where the amazon kindle has apps of a more juvenile nature that is where i need a more advanced tabletapplications that really get the job donefor the fact that i can exploit a much cheaper screen for hours at a time instead of using my premium screens that are attached to bigger memory capacities and other functionalities it really gets the job donedoes it quite well the fire kindle hd is the smaller but well built eco car compared to the suv or pu truck with increased functionality that your u woupd get with a more advanced tabletbut the sd will still get you from point a to point b in a good many casesdepending on your needs,positive
187,lasted longer than i thought far from amazingbut basic features plus camera for the price is amazing does what any tablet should do no issues other than somewhat annoying amazon ad mania backgrounds wallpapers not popups or anything though and child accounts arent really all they are cracked up to be battery life charge time etc normal at this price if kids break it just buy another one cheaper than kid version i really do not see how anyone could buy this taking the price into consideration and not be happy not an ipad but for the price of apro you could buy enough of these for an entire classroom of kids cant go wrong here i have alexa as well plan on getting fire tv next im so satisfied with amazon products,neutral
188,nice unitnot enough memory a few apps books and audio books filled the entire memoryhard for me to buy more if im always needing to delete prior purchasessilk web not compatible with plane internetwhy not use the modern standards,positive
189,i have owned two of these for over a year for my childreni cannot bear to think of the amount oftime in my life i have lost on the phone with customer service regarding these thingswhen they are working well everything is finewhen they arent its an absolute painfor example storagethe wifi connections stop working if there is too much data on the devicesour most recent issue with this was not caused by my children having too many games it came up after they were updated to freetime unlimited and a whole lot of new stuff appearedits not as easy to delete unwanted files as you might think itriedalso each device has both childs profiles on it because they are linked to one account it has to be this way so extra files appear in the other profile taking up valuable room i have just spent an hour on the phone with techs to get this straightened outweve had issue with what my children call glitchiness these things seem to happen randomlyi absolutely dread when my kids tell me something is wrong with their kindlesi will not ever buy another of these once these ones are done in this world ill be looking elsewhere for devices,negative
190,look folks you get what you pay for okay and you have to ask yourself what am i going to use a tablet forfor me i wanted a device to play some videos on the go and read some magazines and bookswhile i am not as much of a technophile as some of the other reviewers here and i like gadgets and i love good technology i am usually the third or fourth kid on the block who gets a new toythis is a mighty fine little media machine for what it was meant to do the resolution is very clear the sound is just wonderful and i have access to all sorts of great media because of the prime membership access yepall of this makes me one happy kidhowever the downside is that i got a machine with onlygigabytes of memory and let me tell you that is just not enough space if you are a media maniac like i amso if you like to read glossy mags on your tablet andor if you are going to do any sort of work on what should be a machine that should be used only for play do do do fork over the extra dough and get more memoryotherwise this is a great machine for the money as much as i love my other mac toys i am happy that i did not spend the extra money on the mac equivalent of this little machine,neutral
191,where to begin first of all i am very shocked out how many positive ratings this tablet has received stunned reallyi have two of the kindle fire hd tablets and two of these fire hdtablets i am not an apple or an ms fanboy i simply want a good working device and unfortunately purchased the fire hdtablet for my kidswe have two of these they are abysmal the battery drains in abouttominutes when in airplane mode while using the device in standby the battery lasts longer but the point of a tablet is to use it sixty tominutes in airplane mode is terrible because amazon essentially requires you to be connected to wifi in order to use any app yes even the apps or games where being connected is not needed the battery dies in less than an hour when connected to wifiif you turn on airplane mode and try to play an app or game you receive a sweet message from amazon stating the license of the app has expired so you connect to wifi and the license renews basically if you want to do anything with the tablet you must be connected and then your battery dies super fasthere is an awesome feature that probably explains why so many review this product in a positive manner when you update the tablet all of your apps and games disappear you then need to redownload them i wonder why apple google or ms does not deploy such a feature on their tablets it is awesome to wake up in the morning and see your tablet updated and all your apps are gone i love having to redownload them on multiple tabletsthe app marketplace is a ghetto version of apple and google it might be slightly better or slightly worse than the windows phone marketplace popular apps in the google marketplace are delayed in release for the fires app updates are delayedamazon recently updated their ui and how you change the settings for the fires omg did they find a blind llama to help with this change for some tasks you need to swipe and tap for days i constantly need to go to youtube to watch videos of how to execute a simple task you need to swipe this then tap here swipe again tap a few more times and after seven or eight actions you are where you need to be why why on earth would you require so many steps to update apps or change parental settings whythe screen is super sharp and bright hence the one star however since the battery life is beyond terrible and the app issues and usability issues a bright crisp screen is just aggravating because you can clearly see how terrible this device really isfor the hatersif this was my experience for one tablet i could be persuaded that i just got a lemon however i have four kindle fires and they all suck also i was at my kids basketball game and my other child has his fire out this was the first time i learned of the new cool feature where all your apps and games disappear with an update i mentioned how frustrating the fire was out loud and a parent in front of me slumped their shoulders their spouse laughed and said their counterpart was an engineer on the fire team the person tried to help thinking it was user error and then realized no it was just built that way the engineer more or less admitted it has serious issuesi suspect most of the positive reviews are from amazonians or people that have never utilized another brands device i really wanted to like the fire hd the surface has a crap marketplace is expensive and wrought with performance issues the ipad is from the evil apple empire i have not had much exposure to droid devices but am not a fan of google wanting to record every life event through their tablets however there is no way i would ever buy a fire hd again it is flat out brutal,neutral
192,i was excited to get to try the fire hd i opted for thegbblue version i was not sure if i would like theversion but as soon as i took it out of the box i knew the size was perfecti think the size and weight are just right i love the clarity of the screeni like that i am able to read my ebooks quickly with no lag timei love how this tablet fits in my hand and gives me the feeling of holding a paperback booki like that it has a camera that is easy to use to take quick pics without having to pull out my phone while i am using m tableti received this product in exchange for a review all my opinions are my own based on my personal experience with the product i am disclosing this in accordance with the federal trade commission’scfr partguides concerning the use of endorsements and testimonials in advertising,positive
193,so far i am loving the newest firei upgraded from aso even those features which were introduced in thefire and new for methe device is much lighter and the display is crisp and cleanthe addition of the cloud collections for audiobooks and apps is a major bonus for me since i like to organize my content my biggest and only so far pet peeve is the tediousness of the collection building in audiobooksthere is no option to add several books at once nor the ability to use the search resultsthe only option is to scroll through the list of books which is very cumbersome when you have overaudiobooks not to mention some with the same title though this may be due to me not finding a better solution,neutral
194,honestly i just got this as a cheap alternative to take to the gym to watch netflix instead of taking my ipad and i had a gift card which is why i got the one with special offers forlesswellthe special offers are annoying when purchasing i had thought they would be somewhat less frequent than they are but they are constant i cant do anything on this tablet without a special offer pop up happeningi get it in terms of marketing but there is no way to shut them off and theyre very annoying during games and netflix i dont notice them as much during music apps but thats because at that point in my workout im at a run and not looking at my screenthe size is nice its difficult to adjust to if youre used to apple products but that isnt amazons faultamazon products have never been user friendly and this is no exceptioni regret buying this device,negative
195,i purchased this when i allowed my hdx to be stolen as a convenient mini replacementi did not realize that the processor was g vs the hdxsso thats on mebut the processing is slow even for g which is actually what most regular tablets have as a rulein addition the onscreen keyboard is inconsistent leaving you helplessthat is likely ram relatedbut the bluetooth is also spotty being paired and connecting and staying connectedlook i love the amazon as much as the next guy if not more and ive owned aboutkindles over the yearsi realized that the thing is just a basic tablet that drives you to use and purchase amazon which i was fine with until i realized that i get better speed more and often better apps with a regular droid tabletthehdx is sweet thojust as good as a notejust amazoncentricwhich is fine as long as you realizesobottom line i would not get this except for a kidor underor someone whos never had a tablet beforesorry zon ol buddy but i gotta honor your legacy of helpful reviews but putting it out there,positive
196,i bought this for my daughter on christmas a week later she dropped it and the screen got shattered i emailed customer support and they said they were sorry this happened and they would replace it i just needed to call them so i called and they said they wont replace it because its not covered under their warranty they state on the commercial that these are twice as durable as the ipad isbut she dropped it fromfeet and it shattered what a joke and they said they would give me adiscount to buy a new one but i need to send in her broken onen so with shipping its hardly a discount im very dissatisfied with the purchase and especially with the customer support instead i will buy her a different tablet with a better warranty and a company who backs up their products,neutral
197,i really like to have an amazon consumption device in my collection of devices this fire hdis an awesome little device notebookcheck puts the soc on par with the tegrai immediately fell in love with theinch form factor a few overlooked and unstated things are the fact that usb otg is functional meaning you can plug in input devices as well as thumb drives they mount at storageusbotg and this device also comes with slimport meaning you can buy a dongle much like an mhl adapter and output video via the microusb port as well as charge the device at the same time even though youre able to attach storage i did buy the gb version so that i wouldnt have to worry so much about installing apps youre going to be hard pressed to find a device this capable as well as something that has the ability to deliver all of the amazon content so seamlessly,neutral
198,was irritatingly and disconcertingly preloaded with my all my personal info history and assumed preferenceswas overloaded with unwanted abhorrent adwarea pantload of preselected apps and games that i had absolutely no interest ini wouldve gladly paid more for a tablet with a clean slatei was thinking of giving it as a gift but i wouldnt want to foist it on some unsuspecting innocent personi wish it were not so maddeningly precustomized,neutral
199,if i were only reading on thisnew kindle maybe it would be more acceptable and maybe not i am replacing a larger kindle for theit feels too small the size of a paperback i was excited about the camera but pictures are cloudy and inferior to what i am used to getting with my cell phone additionally i was listening to music on my oldkindle but switched to thesound is not as good it is not awful but not as loud or as full as the volume on thei have gone back to using my old one most of the time i would not buy theagain,positive
200,went through four kindles all power problems wont charge rapid battery drain wont power on not to mention after frequent use it restarts by itself and freezescrashes a lot all four kindles all the same things even after multiple updates if you think yours wont do it and it was just my four kindles then u r an idiot this device obviously obviously has some serious design flaws save ur money but a different kindle or different tablet,negative
201,no i literally watched a commercial of you advertising a years worth of prime for free on them i ordered oneminutes later and you claimed it was only a month of prime thenweeks later i see a commercial for onlymonth of prime with your purchaseyou flat out lied to your consumer and to be honest i might not use you folks again for any product i needwant,positive
202,it is just okay its good for reading on the kindle or playing games but as for a tablet it is subpar the multiple users interface is weak and we find it having trouble recognizing when we switch from user to user we have to click on a user twice before it recognizes the switch its also quite slow with certain games and apps but i kind of expected that with the nature of a smaller tablet with less memory etcoverall it does what i expected and i cannot say that i am unhappy with it,negative
203,i just got my fire hdyesterday and i have to say im very disappointedfirst lets get one thing clearthe fire hdis an amazing piece of technology im never impressed with the graphics on anything and i was actually impressed by the crystal clear quality of this thing its blazing fast apps seem to download and install in half the time that they take to download and install on mydollar android mobilenow for the bad amazon in trying so hard to make people buy their stuff that they would rather the consumer get everything from them even though there might be another free source for itcase in point there is no epub reader that can be easily downloaded from them even project gutenberg has a review of the fire hd line that says summary if you fancy free ebooks dont buy a kindle fire if i had known it was going to be such a pain to download an epub reader i wouldnt have bought this tablet so readilyi finally downloaded a file manager es file explorer and apk of the fbreader url appsapkcomfbreader for anyone else who needs it it turns out that fbreader runs as smoothly as everything else once you can actually get it theyre pretending it doesnt run so people have to buy the books from amazonand another thing its ridiculous that in this day in age there is no expansion slot for an sd card again theyre doing this on purpose so people have to get the highermemory versions of these tabletsi might add another star to my review once im less irate about these two issues because on every other point the tablet does seem to work well seeupdate do yourself a favor and get an ipad or an android tablet insteadi deeply regret buying this i should have held out for something elsethe app store is so anemic because amazon purposefully keeps it that way there arent even any other browsers because amazon is pushing silk so hardwell today amazon installed a completely terrible update for silk instead of adding features it lost features and its not even an option to just install another browseri went to their help page and its out of dateits still pretty and fast but that is useless given the crappy os,negative
204,summarynice product but dont buy the gb modelspend the additionaland get the gb modelif you dont i assure you will regret it later as you start to take advantage of the fires capabilities for predownloading video and audio contentmemory is not expandable or upgradablerevieiwthe hdhas a great form factorsmall enough to pretty much take everywherethescreen is a little small but i find that its large enough to do just about everything i wantit is also extremely durableive dropped it several times without noticeable damagethe fire is very extremely versatilei use it for music video camera books audible books internet and morewhat i especially like is the ability to download content including amazon prime video musicboth prime and mp books and and audible books so that i can listen and watch it when i dont have wifi or at least a speedy wifi availablebefore i go traveling i download several tv show episodes a movie several albums and and audible book and then as i listen to an episode i delete it and predownload the nexthowever downloading takes a lot of memoryeach movie is about a gigabyte each tv episode is about mb and each album is about mb a song is about mbapps you download also take up memoryso you may think that the gb available for content in the gb version is enough but i assure you it will get used up quickly and you will find yourself constantly struggling to free up space while maintaining enough variety of contentunlike the larger fires like the hdwhere you can add an sd card the hdhas no way to add additional storage so you are stuck with what you buyi assure you its well worth the extraupfrontthe fire has excellent wifi and bluetooth support although unfortunately the bluetooth menu is hidden three levels deep under settingswirelessi wish they would give bluetooth a shortcutit has a single microusb connector for charging but that connector turns out to have a surprising amount of connectivity that i am still just discovering with a simple microusbtousb adapter you can use usb devices including a usb hub from which i have run a keyboard mouse and even added a usb stick storage deviceunfortunately you cant store and play your downloaded amazon prime content on the sd drive because of digital rights management but you can store and play regular mp and mp content and reserve your limited fire memory for amazon content it supports the slimport mydp mobility display port so you can get a microusb slimport adapter to hdmi or vga for aboutand directly display whatever is on you fire screen onto a computer or tv i have used asony and it looks greatfor example i use my fire to watch video on hotel tvs with bluetooth earphones for privacythe only thing i havent yet figured out is how to do both the slimport hdmi and other usb devices at the same timewhen i do i will probably stop bringing a laptop pc on trips and just use the hdfor everythingit has a fair number of apps including most of the popular oneshowever although the fire is is based on the android platform it does not support google play store at least not outofthebox and i often am unable to find apps on amazon that are readily available on my android phone which is very frustrating ive heard of people unlocking the fire and installing google play store but im not ready to do thatif i do i will update this post,neutral
205,i originally purchased a firetablet because it was and continues to be a great value as far as tablets are concerned amazon is an innovator and im happy to see them offer devices that are appropriate for the whole family this little baby packs a good punchthe sound is incredible and for a small fry it definitely has better audio than the firethe graphics are amazing i was impressed when i got the firebut even more so when i started to use this as my primary tabletthe operating system is really userfriendly and all of your mainstream apps are available to download no matter what your needs this is a great place to start or just a great addition to your device collection it is sturdier than the firei know this because my month old niece now prefers to play on my tablet as opposed to the firewhich i bought with her in mind and even got a childfriendly case so that she could drop it and it wouldnt break it did however break but i believe it took a lot of effort on her partshe abused the crap out of it and it finally cracked under her feet when she decided it might be cool to stand on it still shes using the tablet and shes able to navigate the easy babyappropriate interface on her own for the most partamazon tablets are great for anybody and theyre a great deal whats even better is that prime members can make monthly payments and of course we prime members have access to exclusive content on prime video which offers some really amazing original shows as well as popular programs that are available on other streaming servicesdefinitely recommend this if youre looking to upgrade from an amazon firepacks a lot of power for such a small fry,positive
206,i have a kindleinchi thought i lost my kindle hdinch so i bought another onei was using myinch a few days ago i decided to open theinch and try it out and see if there were any new featuresps i found the one i losttherefore i have twoinch hd to compare one that is almostyears old and the one i have been using for the pastdays the new one is sluggish compared to the old one the screen freezes several times a day and trying to go from books to home to recent is a nightmare most of the time the screen will not move or it takes me turning the kindle off and back on to get it to changei am very disappointedi tried deregisteringit and starting try to start it again from scratch nothing changed i also did a test charging them and the old one charged twice as fast as the new one i am not sure if i have a lemon or the new hdinch is just not as good,negative
207,very disappointed and sent it backi found out after receiving it that is was an older modelthen upon using it it linked up with my boyfriends fire and my ereader and screwed them upit was a nightmare that we still havent straightened out on my boyfriends fireim done with amazons fires and wont purchase another one,negative
208,my most favorite thing is the build quality of this device its onlybut it sure doesnt feel that cheap nd thing i love is the size and portability some other good things to point out are the battery life the display and the smoothness of the os and software the only con i have is youtube playback kinda blows it plays the video but doesnt like very good idk and that might be fixable with an update other than that its an awesome device very impressed thank you amazon by the way im using my new kindle fire hdto submit this review lol,positive
209,plusesprice was great perfect size for what i use it forinternet email web facebook musica few other appsminusesseems slowopening appsjust from the time you click an app to openthe ui that was loaded was not very user friendly but with the latest software upgrade it is easy to usevery similar to apple so that is no longer an issue,positive
210,i originally purchased a fire when they first came out and tried to like it but returned it after a few weeksi figured maybe they got it right by this time but it is still not user friendly and is glitchy to say the leastfeels like more of toy than a real tabletmaybe if you never had a laptop or tablet before you would be fine but anyone with expectations will be disappointedthe stupid carousel is still there to annoy you and amazon still hasnt figured out that a carousel goes round and round not ending and needing to be reversed to the beginning,positive
211,i bought the fire hdtablet for christmas last year i have been very satisfied with itits the perfect size especially for travel its small enough to put in my purse or carryon i have found it easy to use im in my fiftiesi wasnt looking for anything high techjust something to use for reading or playing gamesmy grandchildren like to play games or watch movies on iti would definitely recommend it to friends and family,positive
212,im an established fire user as i have owned the original kindle fire for several years i have very small hands and wanted a smaller version that i could grip on both sides thesize was perfect its easy to use and it fits easily inside a pocket or purse i was concerned about reading quality on the smaller size but ive had no issues with it i actually like it better because i can hold it more comfortably in different ways read my first book in it in two days and loved it,positive
213,i love the fire hdtablet there a tons of upgradesimprovements over my old firewhich by the way still works the new tablet is light weight and user friendly my favorite for reading is the paperwhiteit is the perfect ereader but when i want to surf the net check email take a photo and more this works for me the silk browser is cool firefly is wierldy cool its awesome,positive
214,the only thing that fire hd does that my ipad mini doesnt do is play amazon games if you can see them the only thing i can use it for is pictures and music the graphics are great the sound stinks even with ear buds by the time i get the books large enough for me to read it skips wordssometimes sentences thanks to fire i did learn how to use amazon music on my ipadi cant send it back because it was a giftmaybe awould be better for people that has less than perfect eyesightgraphics a little bit better than a smart phone but not as good as ipad,positive
215,so myyear daughter ended up buying the fire hdwith the money she had saved after her old android tablet had died being quite familiar with the android platform i set this up for her so i decided to post a review on what my thoughts were of this android variant tabletfirst off if you are heavily vested in google services mail maps books movies etc you should pass on this tablet this is not a google services friendly tablet yes there are ways to root it and get google services installed and running but that also means voiding the warranty in doing so you can sideload google apps without rooting the device but that also means sideloading the services framework as well as the account manager to get many of the google apps to run and many wont run this also requires you to download the newest version of the app and sideload it each time google updates the app so in short with a lot f work and upkeep you may be able to get some of the google apps to work again this is a walled garden and not a google services friendly tabletnow for the tablet as it is an amazon branded android variant tablet first off fordollars you get a lot of bang form your buck hardware wise the tablet feels solidly built and not cheap feeling at all budget tablet wise this is a pretty good tablet only gb of storage though mine actually showsgb free storage when i look at it with es file explorer but you also have amazons cloud services for music pictures and such so it evens out again with solid hardware this is a pretty good dealnow for the not so good amazon needs to do more work in the software side of this tablet to start their profiles need work even a teenager profile doesnt allow for you to share installed apps camera etc to the child profile only content from the main amazon account holder so this means that after creating a profile for my daughter so i could ensure there were curfew times on the tablet she couldnt get access to many of the features of the tablet like using the camera nor could she get access to any apps installed through the amazon app storelikewise the parental controls for blockingunblocking access to the camera and others features only works on the main amazon account profile what good are parental controls that dont work on child profiles additionally the parental controls pin is the same pin used to make purchases if you enabled that security feature the two should be separate pins then theres the installing of free apps it still requires you to put in the pin to install apps marked as free why so my daughter has to come to me every time she wants to install a free app from the app store just so i can input the pinon top of all that many of the popular apps for android are incompatible with the fire hd tablets like instagram and oovoo for example so again it requires you to sideload the apps and then theres no guarantee they will work this makes for a sorely lacking app store overall i was less than impressed with amazons app store and the selection of decent apps for the amazon firein the end i ended up just letting my daughter use the tablet under my profile and blocking the features i didnt want her to have access to through parental controls and security settings the profiles feature was just too meager in its functionalityoverall if you are heavily vested in amazon services then this tablet is for you however if you prefer the more openness of a straight android tablet you might find the fire hd line a bit frustrating my daughter said she much preferred her old tablet over this one but overall she was able to adequately get what she was looking for on this it took a bit of work and theres not as much granularity in features such as profiles but i guess that goes along with the amazon territory,neutral

218,i bought this for my father and i have to say he really enjoys it for easy browsing on the internet or watching youtube netflix hulu this is a nice device i even used it and for me this is a great device for just simple web browsing have hook to my wifi so unlimited internet time for my father and this device is pretty sturdy too i wouldnt throw on cement but my father drop it numerous time on the wooden floor it havent break yet lol,positive
219,extremely simple to setup and use i had apps downloaded and a kids profile setup within the hour i am not used to the format of the kindle after using an ipad for so long but its easy to figure out so its just a matter of getting use to iti like that i was able to password protect my profile and only allow certain apps and access to my kids the kids profile streamlines the format for kids and myyear old can easily use this i love thay this doesnt have a home screen button so she doesnt press the button accidentally a thousand times she can also hold the screen without it changing on her like on my phonei do find there is a slight lag time on some things like app loads though thats really the only downside but for the price of this its not enough of a downside to really matter to mei would recommend this to someone who wants a tablet for their kids or to share with their kids if solely for the adult and you do a lot on your tablet i may go for something a little faster but for the average adult it doesnt bother me i can watch netflix with no problems so note the lag is with initial loads etc,neutral
220,my dad was the one who recommended the fire hdto me when i mentioned that i wanted a new tablet i thought oh that would save me from buying a tablet and an ereader so i went and placed the order i have had this tablet for about two months and i can say without a doubt in my mind that my experiences with this kindle have been phenomenal lets start with the good things the screen is crisp and bright even with the brightness all the way down i almost always have my brightness all the way down because they die faster with a higher brightness the gb capacity is just the right size for me i dont have a lot of books im working on that and i dont have a lot of music either but i do watch a lot of television and movies and i like to download them from the cloud if i am going on a trip trust me the extrafor the higher capacity is recommended by me you wont regret it the touch screen is very responsive i use a stylus because i like to avoid finger prints and oily skin styluses respond great on the fire hdit has a very friendly interface this has been one of the easiest tablets to navigate through for me it is just small enough to fit in your pocket its not big and bulky which makes it easy to travel withthere are a few cons but none of them are dealbreakers to me it is thick but i knew that going into it it is not super thick but it is thicker than most other tablets but i understand that they had to fit a lot into such a small device i actually prefer it to be thick it makes it easier for me to hold on to it is noticeably heavy i got used to it very quickly but if you like sleek and super light tablets this may not be the best choice for you i dont know if this is just a problem with me but this is not a very good multitasking tablet i will listen to music while surfing the web and the music will crash every few minutes it is kind of annoying it doesnt happen all the time so ive kind of gotten used to it some of the android apps people use are not in the kindle store two of them are instagram and snapchat while it would be nice to have them on here again they are not dealbreakers this tablet dies very fast or at least for me sometimes i dont get a full eight hours before it dies however it does charge fast so that does help make up for thatoverall this is a very wise investment if you are looking for a small tablet that fits in your pocket that wont break the bank then this is the tablet for you,neutral
221,the size is great super light great for reading,positive
222,i absolutely love thisfire tablet its the perfect size to tuck in a purse or even a large pocket i also love all the features i can get with amazon prime that i can use with this tablet the screen is very nice and bright and colors look great ive streamed movies played apps and have read books on it and everything works fine no lag or buffering or any problems playing games everything ive tried ran smoothlyif i had to be critical the only thing i would change is the thickness of the tablet i wish amazon would would release an updated version of this tablet that is thinnerlighter with smaller bezels no other manufacturer has a tablet in this size range with this quality and offers the vast ecosystem of amazon there are plenty ofandtablets out there but no qualitytablets so an updated version would be great the tablet downloaded the newest software without a problem and i also purchased the genuine amazon origami style case for it the case works great at propping up the tablet in both landscapeportrait but it isnt big on protection if you are prone to dropping your device i would give this itemstars,positive
223,i have been been upset as i did not receive thegig memory device i thought i had opted for and the other item i was a bit upset with is the low volume on high volume on the audio portion of the device now for the rest of the fire as i have had time to use it and love iti pack two laptops up and sold them so i could not go back to them forced myself to learn and enjoy the fire and i have done just thatwith the two issues i wish i had bought the next size up for the stereotype audio that may have give me more volume the memory issue was just what was avail at the time i am glad i had bought an aux cable at time of purchase as i can use an usb mem stickwould i go back to my laptop for what i do with my fire noi love it and if i use it all the timethanks for designing a device that works well for my needs uses,neutral
224,im in love this is my nd hd the first one arrived defective and amazon promptly sent a replacement its cute small and had a great display yes due to there being only one speaker the sound isnt great but it is when used with headphones or an external speaker great buy as a first tablet or as a media consumption device i now haveipads and three fire tablets which i use at different places and for different reasonsenjoy,positive
225,i love my kindle fire hdmy son received one for christmas from his aunt and i must say i eyeballed it for about a month before breaking down and purchasing one for myself it has so many amazing features unlike other tablets or ebook readers you have the ability to set up individual profiles for each family member and can limit what your children have access to on their profile you can add specific apps books or games on each persons profile and remove the ones you dont want them to have access to the fire hdhas ascreen which is a great size for reading books you can adjust the settings to make the font easier to read and it comes with unlimited storage in amazon cloud so you can keep up with important photos and documents it features and mp rearfacing camera as well as a frontfacing camera perfect for skype or other video chatting has anhour battery life and is lightweighti am also thrilled that i have access to all of my prime instant videos and my prime music library so i can take my movies and music just about everywhere i go i am also not a huge fan of reading but since having my fire hdit makes reading more fun and i love reading on it it has also helped my son learn to love to read also he has moved up a grade reading level since he got his kindle it used to be a fight every night trying to get him to do his reading homework but not anymore he has an app the school suggested and he reads aboutbooks a night i love all the different kinds of apps you can download i enjoy taking a break and playing a game or two on it in my free timeit is definitely worth every penny of thei normally wouldnt pay that much for a tablet but with all the features it comes with you actually end up saving in the long run this fire hdmakes a perfect gift for anyone so simple to use and set up is a breeze you can share your previously purchased amazon app store apps on all of your connected devices so you only have to purchase an app once they have daily deals on apps in the app store,neutral
226,i was so excited to try out this tablet as i have been a longtime techie and mac devoteeso preparing to take a walk on the wild side i ordered my fire with gleethe included prime access fordays was something that very definitely appealed to my kids who immediately began clamoring to stream videos on the generously sized screenthe device was still small enough to comfortably fit in one hand and the incredibly fast start to usage was amazingthe device arrived indays withbattery charged and was ready to use in underminutesthe installation of my amazon account was seamless as were the prompts to link my social media streams to the appsone of the small frustrations i have found is that the apps available are still lightyears behind the appstore and googleplay in terms of available choicesmany of the apps i use on my iphone for free cost money to have the amazon approved version and although the enclosedpage easy to use guide states it will handle android apps the transition was less than seamless trying to add them to my device from my play accounta large part of that was google claiming id never used the device with that play account before and not allowing me to progress furtherthis was a small hiccup in an otherwise wonderful experience with kindle fire and i am very glad that i elected to spring the extrafor the additionalgb of hard drive spacethe cloud storage setup was painless and i love the functionality of being able to read my books on either my iphone or my kindlefor all you mac devotees reading this and snickeringbattery life amazing with all my apps open using location services on them and streaming videos from the prime store my kindle lasted an eye openinghours on a single chargedaylight visibility flawlessi could stream or read easily in full sunlight without eye straincompared to my iphone night and daywhile i dont foresee this replacing my laptop anytime soon i will definitely be enjoying this device for many years to comewell done kindle,positive
227,i was so disappointed in this i thought finally a tablet underfor my kids and software to regulate my kids digital usetwo stars because this kindle fire hdfulfilled those two for mebut it failed in everything elsei received it just in time for christmas and promptly charged it up and installed apps on it hoping to set up the rest latereight gigs is paltry for any digital device but at that price i was prepared to compromiseproblem is that the kindle fire doesnt handle apps like i thought it wouldif you install an app for one profile say the adult profile and then you make a profile for one of your kids the kindle installs two copies of that appif its lego batman thats gb per profilealmost three gb which is almost half of the space advertisedbut wait almost three of those gigabytes is used up by the systemso i thought son youre going to have to pick which three games under three gigs you want to have and well have to go to the arduous process of uninstalling a game and installing another game every time you want to play something newoh and theres an offer of one month of amazon freetime unlimited that you cant use because you dont have space to use anything they offerwell you do you just have to whip out a calculator and compute how much disk space you can usetv shows yeah rightand were really only talking about one childs profiletheres no way you could do two kids on this thingso i would suggest to you mr and mrs parent to either buy a proper android tablet that can accept an sd card or get the gb version of this kindlebut also be wary of the osit seems pretty speedy when you get into the app youre using but installing and deleting apps is painfulthere are no physical buttons other than the power button so if an app stops responding you have no choice but to hard reset itthese are the kind of things i didnt think my seven year old needed to troubleshooti usually read reviews ad nauseam before i make a purchase but i didnt for thisi saw the brand and the pricelesson learned,neutral

229,worse batt life ever totally regret this purchase i had a nd generation that had a batt life of likeweeks i would go on vacations wout the charger this on the other hand cant leave my bedroom wout the charger i would buy a paperwhite if you just wanna read books,negative
230,i love this little tablet i bought it as an ereader because it was so much cheaper than the standalone kindles and it would also grant me access to my nook library through using a backdoor method to download the nook app after my yearsold nook had passed its prime and i didnt want to lose the books i had purchased through it i would dearly love to be able to transfer those books into my kindle library but unfortunately theres really not a good way to do that despite many things i read and tried i didnt want another nook since ive come to kinda live and die by amazon so i settled for just downloading the nook app as mentioned above so id still have access to them this tablet was the cheapest one at the time i bought it and certainly suits my needs i can download all the basic apps like facebook twitter netflix hulu sling tv solitaire a few random games and of course all the amazon apps like alexa music video cloud etc is it comparable to an ipad no nowhere close but i didnt buy it to serve as an ipad i bought it as a small easytotuckinabagorpocket ereader it performs that beautifullyand then some very happy with this purchase,neutral
231,i have a few android devices but i love thistablet i am still in a learning curve as to what i can do but i am positively cool with the size of course i love kindle but i can skype and listen to my music library and stream all kinds of genres i would highly recommend great video resolution,positive
232,the price was right but the screen size was too small if you like to ready books or watch movies on the kindle its just to small i decided to return thisfor thealso the sound quality on theis not as loud,positive
233,i bought my son an ipod last christmas and enjoyed using it myself now and then so i really wanted to try out a tablet but without the hefty price tag i have been a kindle user for quite a while and have always had good experiences with them and with customer service when anything did go wrong i started out with a kindle keyboard then the kindle touch i wanted to wait a month or so to write my review so i could give it a fair review and i have to say that i love it for reference i use it mainly for reading surfing and app gamesmy impressionsreading as great an experience as with the other kindles there are more font selections background selections and i love the fact that it has a backlight and i did not have to purchase an extra cover solely to have a light when i read the weight is a little heavier when i read at night but not enough to be bothersome the backlight is quite bright at night but it has an easily accessible brightness setting that works greatthis might sound like a minor thing but i loooove being able to see the book covers in color it always irked me that on the other kindles they were black and whitesurfing although it is a little slower than my sons ipod i find it to be satisfactory for my needs i have not had any major issues with the silk browser at all youtube seems to play just fine for me and actually when i downloaded an app to try to make it a little better i ended up uninstalling it because in the browser view it works just fine if not betterapps and games the games and apps i have downloaded to it run smoothly and i have not had any trouble with them save the aforementioned problem with the youtube one and they seem to work just fine there are many good ones for free and the others are very reasonably pricedmusic well i really have not used this feature much except here and there but that is because i have a perfectly fine mp player that i love the few songs i have played have played well and the speakers are very nice and clear i almost bought the kindlehd for the dual speakers but opted for thebecause i liked the smaller size and that i could get more gb for a lower pricemovies i cant really speak to this because i have not downloaded any movies nor do i plan tostorage as of this review i have a hundred or so books downloaded maybe about twenty apps and several songs and have had no space issues as of yet maybe if i downloaded movies or more music i might i dont know but as i stated before i never intended to use it for that anywaytidbits it was very easy to learn how to navigate and the settings are within easy reach the camera seems to work well but needs a lot of light to take really good clear pictures this could just be me though i really have not used it enough to be able to say that i am using it to its full potentialso to sum up this quite long review i am very satisfied with my firehd so much so in fact that i bought one for my mother for christmas,positive
234,very disappointedbattery does not hold up through a full dayuse primarily for reading skips pages sometimes has trouble and puts part of last page on next pagegoing back to my paperwhite its easier to hold read and the battery lasts for dayswill buy a new ipad to do everything else on,negative
235,i like the kindle this is the third kindle i have and its probably the one that gets used the mosti got it for my son the aim with the tablet was two fold first entertainment it does come with freetime which means he can download apps and second an incentive to read once school starts to unlock games and such i will be making full use of the parental controls insert evil laughanywaywe had ahour cross country trip i downloaded minecraft and a couple of audiobooks minecraft on the tablet was a hithe has not finished his audiobooksalthough i know he will be likely to listen to them when building legos thankfully this has access to audible where i already had a couple of percy jackson bookswhat i dont likei feel it takes forever to fully charge and the battery could last longer it annoys me that it comes preloaded with all my books and audiobooks most of my content isnt kid friendly and i have to always check these kindles to make sure whatever i downloadbuy for my consumption in my own device doesnt appear in the carousel this is alrightbut annoying,neutral
236,i have had the original kindle fire since it came out and it has been great i say has since it just died on mejust refused to turn on one day so since amazon launched a new generation of devices recently i knew that it was time for a new one sadly i dont feel that the hdhas been worth the money i bought one at retail which did not work so i exchanged itmy first big complaint is that it seems and i could be wrong so someone please tell me if i am that i only had the option of getting this device with special offers re advertisements for stuff i wont buy i didnt know this when i bought my first one so i asked the salesman when i went for the exchange if i could get one this time without the special offers he said that this wasnt an option as far as he knew that they didnt sell them without the special offers grrrr i have since looked on amazons site but have seen no mention of this being an option there eitherjust have to suck it up and deal with itmy second big complaint is that the battery life is horrible on my st gen fire i could set it aside with acharge and easily expect to come back to it a week later and see that it still had some juice with this new and improved model i have had acharge run out in a day or so without ever turning the thing on it just drains power like a sieve i havent been able to put any serious time in on it since when i do get to set down with it i need to recharge it againall in all the hdmay have some features beefed up but i would rather have spent the money to get my old one up and running than to be stuck with this,neutral

244,pretty disappointed in this kindlei have owned most of the various kindle tablets and readers and this is by far the worst of the bunchi do like amazon and its tabletsbut this is the first one ive returnedi know youre probably saying what do you expect from atabletbut id rather spend a little more and get a tablet with better battery lifeill start with the goodthe screen is clear with good resolution doesnt have the blue hue at the edges of the light colored screens like the hdx did when it first shipped easy to navigatechange settings and decent sound from the speakersnow the badvery poor battery lifei was able to get just overhours in standby modethis is with the screen off and all alertsreminders turned offnot acceptable for a modern tablet at any price rangei had this issue with the fire hdx but a software upgrade from amazon a couple months ago solved that issueits a very heavy tablet for its sizemakes it difficult to hold for extended periods of timeits also very thickits as heavy and as thick as the original kindletabletif youre going to be near a power source all the time or just go on short trips this may work for youi prefer my nexusover the kindlemuch lighter thinner faster and more versatile,positive
245,i have purchased quite a few tablets in the past few years and this one is by far the best its small enough to hold like a book and carry in my purse i can do everything i normally would on my computer without taking up space i have downloaded over a thousand free books and have my favorite music at my fingertips i take my littlefire tablet everywhere i gothe charge holds well and i can also use it while its charging if need be i would much rather use my kindle than my ipad or a smartphone any dayi also love the support i have consistently received from amazon i have yet to find a problem that amazons tech support cannot fix absolute best company ever,positive
246,the amazon fire has always been toted as premium device so when they released this budgetfriendly version i was a little skeptical ive owneddollar tablets before and they werent the best devices they were slow felt cheap and couldnt do most things the fire hdis a completely different storyi thought i paid twice as much for this guy the performance is snappy the display is clear and crisp and it has few if any hardware issues the build quality is great at this price range its got a lot of its competitors beat for the average user this tablet alone should cover most of your browsing streaming and gameloving needsmy biggest gripe with this tablet is that its not stock android im a huge fan of the android os and its ecosystem amazon took the original aosp and modified it to produce fireos it has many aosp elements but definitely takes a different approach to user interactions if youre not an avid android fan it wont hurt to pick up a fire if you are you may want a different primary tablet,neutral
247,i like this tablet very much after help from tech support and updating system all sites ok but i have to tap the icons many times over and over again before the icon is launchedperhaps i have to get used to it sometimes i tap lightly and all okmy cheap metro samsung works much better and i only paidfor itif doesnt work as it should might send back and buy the next one upwell i gave it many triesi really like the feel of it in my hands and tech support don was great in helping me set it up correctlyperhaps designers can look into if this and see if this is happening to other users and that is the icons not responding to the touch to launchthey eventually do work but i have to keep taping and taping on them until they dosorry amazon but sending it back,positive
248,i bought this for my daughter who loves reading and she absolutely loves it it is the perfect tablet its nice and small and easy to hold when reading it works really fast also the color is really pretty as well and i am very satisfied and so is my daughter,positive
249,when i purchased this tablet i paid an extraso i wouldnt have advertisements the tablet was on some special sale and theseemed less obnoxious than if i had paid the regular price i kept seeing what looked like ads but i wasnt sure just how much freedom from amazon ads myreally covered i let quite a while pass still wondering whether or not i had wasted the extra cash until one day i turned the tablet on and it was unmistakablethese were ads intrusive insistent unwanted ads i called amazon customer service and it took a long time to straighten things out the customer service person insisted that nothing was wrong and that i got the tablet i ordered the tablet was on sale forand the ad free was an extramy screen showed the special offer the extraand the daily special priceand her screen showed the tablet atwithout the special offer apparently all she could see is that i ordered and received atablet she finally got the ads off of my tablet because i insisted and i even offered to send her the screenshot shows in my order history of this adfree deal for whatever reason she could not see the deal i bought she refused the offer of a screenshot and sounded as if she did not believe what i was telling her she claimed to be doing me a favor in removing the ads because i am a valued and loyal customer please the screen shot of the transaction would have confirmed my position whatever she was looking at was different than my actual transaction that may be because i took so long to realize the ads were really ads and finally complain anyhow amazon handled this and im happy would have beenstars if i didnt spend such a long time on the phone trying to straighten this out,neutral

251,generally like the product just the right size and the screen is sharper than some of the other kindle productsmy problem is that whenever i read a book on another device ipad the fire hd fails to sync to the latest page going the other way the ipad can always be easily and correctly updatedwhen i talked to kindle support i was told that this is a known issue and we are working on itsince this has already been occurring for months i have little hope that the problem will ever be solved,positive
252,let me just say this this thing is awesome this version of the kindle fire is in my opinion the best deal out there at the time of writing this it has a very high definition screen a good processor a decent amount of ram and a decent amount of storage lets get into itscreenthe screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for the price it has a ppi ofwhich is better than the hdthis screen is very responsive and does not have a terrible amount of glare in my testing the screen did not scratch very easily and has held up very well to drops there does seem to be quite a bit of bezel along the top and bottom but this can be overlooked at this price point overall the screen is greatbatterywhen i first got this tablet the battery was pretty good it lasted abouthours depending on what you were doing however now that i have had the tablet for over one and a half years the battery has gone down a little it is still not too bad but it is noticeably lower it lasts abouthours now depending on what you are doingperformancethis tablet performs very well when i first got it it was running fire osand could handle things quite easily now it is running fire osand seems just a tad bit faster i can haveweb tabs open while listing to music and haveing multiple other apps open the hddoes not fall short in this categorydurabilityi have this device inside a poetic case and it has had many face first encounters with the floor i have yet to crack the screen and the bezel has not cracked either the screen had avoided a lot of scratches with this case because of the built in screen protectorappstorethis is one place that all amazon devices fall extremely short the app store on these things is very bad there is not much to choose from and the things that are there are not very good luckily it is fairly easy to sideload apps onto this device the amazon appstore has much to be desiredcamerathe camera on this device is also not so good it does a decent job in bright natural light like outside but does pretty bad inside i should say that when trying to take pictures with this inside there was not much light in the room also night pictures are almost impossible the camera is fine for video chatting but not for much of anything elseoverall this is a very good device and i highly recommend it the few things that i pointed out as cons are forgivable at this price point the app store is not as good as i had hoped and i never use the camera however one last thing that i will mention is that there is no sd card slot this makes download movies hard since they fill up your storage quite fast i would definitely get this over the hd,neutral
253,i have had this a couple of days and it seems to be working greatit is very lightweight and feels about the same size as a paperback bookmyverizon tablet never really felt comfortable for reading booksthis fire tablet has a sort of night light feature which guards against eyestrain and also stops the type of light from coming through that keeps you awake at nighti also like the fact that i was able to buy ascrabble app which did not make me look at commercialsyeahthis app works greatso far i really love my new th generation firei also purchased a san disk card to increase the memory function for this device when amazon told me these items are purchased togetheri did not find a micro disk slotthe other thing is that i thought that amazon did not give me a charger with it only a usb cord but i looked in the box again and under a small black box the charger which is small itself may be found,positive
254,this product score has to be clarifiedactually when the fire hd is working it is a star productit would be a star product but it is small and the screen can be a little hard to read however it is about the size of many cellphones today so if you consider that size acceptable you will be fine with this sizeit is quite portable as wellthe reason i gave it ais that amazon needs to be ashamed of itself for making a product that is so easy to breakone drop on a floor or driveway and the front glass can shatterand i do mean shatterif you are going to buy it you may want to get the extended warranty which they say covers dropsotherwise you may have wasted your moneythats what happened to memy husband has this tablet for less than a month when he dropped it it shatteredi called amazonthe warranty on it did not cover dropsthey have no repair serviceno repair serviceas large as amazon is they do not repair their productsthey can experiment with drones but not repair their own productsthey also dont recommend the rdparty screen that says it replaces the fire screenthe agent with whom i spoke was condescending when i called i said i thought this thing was supposed to be shatter proof she said that the kids version is the one they advertise as shatter proofthen she added that they dont expect adults to need the same type of protection that kids needobviously they havent looked on ebay so see all of the fires with broken screens sometimes adults have boo boos like kidswho knewamazon could use the same technology for the adult version as they do for the kidsadd a little to the price for the upgrade and then people like me would not be wastingon something that breaks so easilyi was suckered into that horrible christmas in july sale and then i get a product that is useless in less than a monthoh i did get offeredoff a new firethey do not offer much to help with a replacementi would have upgraded to the higherend fire if i could have gotten sayoff for the return of this broken oneamazon doesnt allow that eitheri am so disappointed with this companythey left me with a piece of junk and i had to deal with an agent that treated me like the only adult in the world who ever dropped this thingby the way the manager with whom i asked to speak gave me a little more off a replacement fire but i still felt insultedits not expensive enough to want to replace with so little money off and its too expensive to want to waste your money if something happensthe one star is for making a product that is essentially a throwaway product if something happens to it,negative
255,works great good for travelbut the extra color and power required mean it does not hold a charge as long as my old paperwhite that could go a week easily ah well to be expected i suppose given the many extra functions just expect to take your charge cabledownsidei wish the colorshading for reading had more settingsi read at night in bed and dont like disturbing my husband the setting are still too bright and the white text on black the darkest setting available give eyestraini wish the paperwhite text settings were available on the fire they were much more comfortable on the eyes this is my biggest gripe and what i mainly use the fire forsometimes the screen is a little too touchy and books open when i just wanted to scroll through the library,neutral
256,i had a fire hdthat was getting too difficult to lug around so i decided to get themodelwhich was such a pleasant surprise i get all the functionality of the larger model in a tablet that fits in my front pockets if you accept that the device ischeaper than the cheapest ipad you will be extremely happy and satisfied with this tablet perhaps the only suggestion to amazon would be to ensure the tablet is running the latest os before shipping i spent about two hours upgrading from x to x but other than that startup work the tablet has been functioning flawlesslyi primarily use it for the kindle texttospeech which works extremely well and is good enough to skip the audible versions of books i also use it to shop on amazon and some light streaming on youtubei highly recommend this tablet for someone with a prime account you wont regret it it will do most internetbased tasks with ease,neutral
257,great buy this kindle isawesome though some set backs the amazon app store is very limited and doesnt have some social media like instagram and snapshot but with some little hacking if you want to call it you can get the full google play store there are videos for it on youtube it is powerful enough to run my favorite apps like hearthstone and is the perfect size to feel like a tablet as well as a phone one thing i have noticed is that it wont pick up my touches sometimes but that rarely happens this version does not come with a micro sd slot but you can find adapters to plug into the kindle that will expand the storage from its max of g any how this is a great tablet and the addition of the google play store and extra storage will make this budget tablet feel more expensive,neutral
258,i bought this as a gift for my daughter the price is good it’s compact portable and looks to have very good features especially for my daughter i love the fact that you can even have separate profileshowever that is just about the only good thing about this tablet i got a wifi version but it just wouldnt connect to any wireless internet connection i have research on the internet gotten in touch with amazon and they dont seem to have a clue as to what is happening or how to even resolve it i am just wondering if this has been happening to the kindle how come they have not been able to fix this with an update or these new tabletsit’s now just a piece of useless item i have and cant return it because i have travelled aboard,positive
259,this was an upgrade i purchased for my wife over her original kindle firewhen they were first released i as her admin specialist love this one much more since it really now resembles android there are many features in the new os which are a great improvement over the original my biggest complaint is the memory limitation since you cannot use a microsd to expand itfor a long trip i had to carry a portable drive to transfer videos over to it for the wife due to the limited storage of only gb the screen looks great the battery lasts and my wife actually uses this kindlehours or more a day compared to her original one,neutral
260,i received this kindle for christmas the touchscreen never worked it was returned to amazonanother was purchased at best buy thinking it would be easier to return if touchscreen didnt workthe kindle worked formonths before it started to become very very hotthe charger also became very very hoti called amazon they refused to replace it with a new kindle and sent a visibly old kindle without a charger as a replacement i will return that to themthey were extremely difficult to work with as wellone agent lied to me and said refurbished meant it was brand new but had been sent to the wrong addressi looked up online an apparently heating up is a common problem with these kindlesthe defective new kindle should have been replaced with a new working kindlei wont shop amazon products againi will be contacting the better business bureau i cannot recommend this product,neutral
261,this is great value for what you pay for i had ahd fire for a few years but this is a smallermore maneuverable sizemy only gripe arethere is only a usb port on the older model there is an extra hdmi port which i can easily connect to my receiver for excellent audio and video output audio output even via the usb port is mono channel only i am used to listening to prime music thru my receiver in surround sound on the older modelthis is a big disappointmenthowever if you want a low price mini tablet on the go there is no better product on the market,positive
262,idont know why i bought this kindle i have a hdx and a rd generation paperwhite that said i really like the smaller size the picture and sound quality is very good when watching video the gb doesnt have a lot of available storagehowever if you have wifi storage is no big deal with amazon free cloud storage its cute snappy and a lot of fun to use its inexpensive yet build with amazon quality it also is the perfect size if you want a color ereader for children i would recomend the gb because they like to have more downloaded overall i would highly recomendits value is greatly increased with prime membership,positive
263,a great value for a small tablet i bought it for work so i had access to email and books and wont be heartbroken if i lose it the screen is not super bright but adequate i wish it had a mute button the reason i took off one star is the audio its not very loud and the speaker is on the back aimed away from the listener you have to cup your hand to make the sound decent not sure why the speaker was not on the bottom solid buildgood entry level device for basic browsing reading watching video not a gamers tablet was very easy to set upintuitive and simple,positive
264,excellent there is a newer better version available for this but i am not interested this tablet has done everything i could of ever asked of it the video is fantasticas long as my wifi isnt acting up i get great quality video while streaming the sound is a bit quite when it isnt plugged in but isnt a problem with headphones i have also dropped it several times once before i bought a case and it worked just fine afterwards i do also have an ipad and while it does offer better performance and more perks i actually use the kindle more often not just for books either netflix and of course amazon prime video if you dont mind losing out on some unessential perks that the ipad offers and want to pay a fraction of the cost the kindle is definitely the way to go,neutral
265,night readers beware you will still have a lot of light coming out i have trieddifferent blue light filters and there is still too much light coming out my last kindle fire was great with an added blue light filter this one when you dim it low you cant read the letters so it defeats the purpose im working on another blue light filter now to see if it will work or i will return it so bummed other than that its a great device the paperwhite is also not good for night reading still puts off a lot of light yes you can dim it but then the letters dim out too sort of dumb if you ask me but i guess they didnt really test that part,neutral
266,ive had one of these since just before christmas my wife expressed envy so i immediately bought her one she has been on it almost constantly sinceshe watches much more video on hers than i do on mine but she loves it she can now kick back on our bed in the bedroom and watch tv instead of having to be on the couch in the living room she can also watch with earphones if i dont want to hear it or if we both want to watch something different and since we just cut the cord with a fire tv she can have the same experience on our tv and on her fire tableti will say i actually find video looks nicer on our iphones and a bit more responsive but these have bigger screens so watching anything longer than a short clip is a nicer experience on the fire tableet,neutral
267,amazing forfor thegb versioni own android ios and windows tablets and this little tablet is at least as good overall in some ways even better than all these tabletsthe fire hduses amazons version of androidyou can only download apps from amazons app store which is not as limiting as some people might have you believeall of your mainstream apps facebook skype pandora adobe reader office etc are available for fire tabletsif access to all android or ios apps is important to you dont get a fire tableti use all my tablets mainly for internet and watching moviesfor the internet i havent found the silk browser lacking in any wayit loads pages fast and has no problems with web video contentfor movies this device rocks because you can download content from both your amazon and flixtser library ios and windevices can download only from flixsterunfortunately i have only aboutgb so i can load a few flixster movies but i also have a video collection on a thumb drive that can be accessed by the fire hdthrough a micro usb otg cableusing the micro usb otg cable you can also access photos and music from a thumb drive something you cant do with an ipadi also like to use my tablets with my tvi have both chromecast and fire tvthe chromecast has been great for playing video content from my chromebook wintablet ipad mini and android tableti cant connect to the chromecast from the fire hdbut it works great with the amazon fire tv stick of coursefrom my fire hdi can cast or fling amazon calls this feature second screen content from netflix and amazon video to the fire tv stick the fire hddoes not seem to support mirroring you need to step up to the fire hdxto do miracast mirroring though i understand you can connect the fire hdto a tv through a special hdmitominihdmi cablelastly i found a remote control app for my lg smart tvits nice to be able to control the volume and tv input source from the fire hd bottom line it is a fantastic tablet,neutral
268,i wanted to love this but the truth is it lags it freezes you unlock and instead of opening to the book im reading i get a black screen to unfreeze i need to power off and back on i do this at least once a day more oftentimes a day the download speed for a show i would like to watch on the train is slow but the quality is good if you dont mind having to restart several times a day and dont want to use it as a regular tablet youll be fine the price was right and im coping with it i bought it for books and shows while making my weekend train trips,negative
269,i bought this because i read a very lengthy review from someone here that said this was so much better than theand it wasnt worth it to buy the next one up because there werent really any changes or upgrades the camera on this one is awful i wont even use that it is so slow and doesnt seem to recognize my touch until i press at leasttimes i wish i didnt buy this and either bought theor waited for thei am totally disappointed i was so excited to receive it and was instantly crushed id return it but i already bought the case for it and threw the packaging away for that,neutral
270,invest in a better tablet and you will be much happier this device only has the amazon app store with a much smaller range of apps the youtube app for instance is unavailable for this as well as chrome the device itself is pretty underpowered and simple games lag and stutter they really push the coin system but i dont think its really worth it i do like their underground app model where games are really free meaning in app purchases are free but not really that great because you can sideload the amazon appstore onto any other android deviceprospriceconstouchscreenapp selection,positive
271,this is a nice little device it is not as nice as an hdx tablet but then it was soo much less expensive the screen is very clear the sound is okay certainly good enough for a movie or tv show not great for listening long term to music it is a little slower and less responsive than i would like but then i am learning to be patient it is a chunky little tablet but very easy to hold in one hand which i love i especially love reading books and can do so at night with the blue shade so that i have no trouble then falling asleepfor the price and i got it fori think this is a great little tablet i did a lot of reading up on it and it got pretty good reviews from a variety of sources so i am glad i bought it and found the reviews to be true,positive
272,i have both the fire hdand the firedevices and i like both but i much prefer thethis is my go tablet and i keep it with me almost all the timethe physical size of the device is what wins it for me i can drop it in my bag or even in my pocketthe only drawback is i bought the gb and really should have invested in the gbi have several books on it but i also enjoy playing gamesand there have been a couple i couldnt install because they were too big with the other things i refuse to deletebut even still this is my favorite kindle device,positive
273,i have been owning ipad foryears and just thought of giving a try with kindle bought a kindle hda week ago and it is simply outstanding have been using it for reading and browsing ever since i got the experience is amazing and the outlook emails synced faster than my ipad and htc phone what an amazing product it is and worth the moneyprosemails are fasterbrowsing is smoothbattery life is good and getting more than hours for reading compact for carrying it aroundconspicture loads slow on bookshelf app maybe an issue with app or not enough processor overall its an amazing product and ordering a hdxtoo,positive
274,i used to have a ipad minibut after it died i didnt want to spend a lot of money on a newer one so i ordered this since all i do is watch tv shows and movies on my tablets it works amazing and i love it and it was very affordable too wow,positive
275,might be one of the best investment to myself after my fitbit blaze which is another story thanks to my fire hd i now am able to read and learn more it is just fun i can switch between many booksmagazines and read wheneverwherever i need before i bought this i debated between paperwhite version and apple products but was not able to justify the additional price i would need to paypros very reasonably priced light long battery life wide variety of books to pick from there are many free books toocons never used amazon products before so main screen took some getting used to i think amazon should somehow add more foreign language books i am sure with time this will happen too,positive
276,i knew even when ordering this that i shouldnt expect much from a tablet this inexpensive my two gripes maybe dont matter to most but this is a review of performance after all first battery life dont count on more than one day off the charger if i used it constantly there would be a reason i suppose but i only use it occasionally and need to keep it plugged in my other big problem is setting the time and date you cant the only provision for this is setting your time zone and the time and date is set automatically through the network which if it actually kept the correct time would be great but aboutof the time i turn the fire on its displaying the wrong time since i already set my time zone the only option is completely shutting down the tablet and restarting for these two reasons along with other screen freezes and crashes i cant really say i recommend it,neutral
277,i so enjoyed everything about reading an actual book the way it felt smelled the way you could skip ahead to the end that i resisted even considering a kindle until carrying a very heavy book on a long trip then i told my kids id try one but didnt think id like it boy was i wrong im not missing anything most certainly not the weight of a heavy book in fact i find myself reading even more books than i ever did and ive always been a vorascious reader if youve never tried one do it now that theyre even smaller and easier to take along with a limitless supply of books on every subject thanks kids for knowing better than i did,neutral
278,i love this town from the moment i bought it the interface is amazing the outer looks are awesome the camera is wonderful i suggest buying this to anybody it is amazingi suggestgetting a case just to be safe but it is truly phenminal picture quality is reasonably great id recommendplease mark this helpful if was so ty,positive
279,since i have mixed opinions on this kindle ill list out the pros and conspros its very simple to use reading on it isnt bad at all start up is very quick and the device runs smoothly when youre not downloading something bigcons theres not enough space i understand that its only gb but when you go in and look at how much space you actually have its only about gb after whats preloaded on the device theres not a port to put a sd card inthats about all i have to say on the cons partoverall this is a good kindle to start with if youre looking into getting one yes theres not a lot of space but it will hold a good amount of books,positive
280,i really enjoy being able to take my books with me on the go i have been using the kindle reader app for quite some time and i hated lugging my laptop around everywhere to be able to read the fire hdis wonderful for a lover of books like myself it downloads a book in literally a few seconds and you are ready to read i have no complaints at all the only thing i would caution someone buying this tablet is that if you have any difficulty seeingneed large print etc you may want a bigger screen i have no trouble but my grandmother cant use this one because she needs a larger screen but this is a screen size issue otherwise this fire is awesomedisclaimer i received this item free of charge to facilitate this review all opinions arepercent my own,positive
281,i am still learning how to use thisit is my first technology investment i am very behind on the innovation of the iphones tablets etc so far i am enjoying it very mucheventually i plan to join amazon prime to have access to more stuffi just discovered this thing called the cloud and realized all the music ive purchased the pictures and videos ive taken all are thereit was so cooli know i sound stupid buy hey we all got to start somewhere with all this modern stuffi am very happy i purchased thisi have access to the web anywhere there is a wifi set upim sure i have not even scratched the surface of its functionalityalso nice to know i wont be cluttering my bookcases any more with hard bookswhat can i sayit took me a while to embrace it,positive
282,i cant write enough how pleased i am with my fire hdits everything i had hoped for and morethe display is amazing speed is great i cant think of a flaw to tell you about what a wonderful product especially for the price ive watched movies read books played games surfed the web sent emails and shopped and have not encountered one issue thank you amazon love my fire,positive
283,we stopped buying ipads for our kids these are cheaper the kids love them they do all the same things sure it could be argued that the camera and video technology is not the same as the ipad but for the average user or a child the extra money is not worth a difference that i or my three kids agecan notice great product instead of one ipad that three children fight over we have three of these now im so pleased that next time i buy a tablet which i use for movies on planesemail and books only i will just buy one of these instead of an ipad at four times price,positive
284,im really happy with the size of the hdtableti already had a fire hdwhich i use a lot but which was just a bit to large to fit into my purse when i wanted to take it with methis one slips right into the space i havealso its easier to use to read in bed at night since its easier to hold in one handbut its still heavier than i expectedeasy to use and clear crisp fonts when reading make this item a winner in my opinionalso i really like the blue shade for night reading and find it much easier to fall asleep when i turn the fire off,positive
285,little disappointed because i did not read the description well enough i was looking at thekindle which had a slightly larger screen but lower resolution the greater thing was it had expandable memory with an sd card i thought i would spend a little extra and get the tablet with better resolution and did not notice that it does not have expandable memorythe kindle itself works well and the resolution is nice although truth be told i probably wouldnt be able to spot the difference between this one and the cheaper modelthe app storebheahi have a bunch of apps on my iphone which i also wanted to be able to use on my kindle games nest these are not in the app store there is a work around for most of it although my game needed google play which i havent been able to get a version that works from the third party sitei do like that i can now use all of the advantages of my prime account and use the borrow books feature although it sucks they dont have that for their iphone appa good basic kindleto improveexpandable memory and a couple of rubber grips as it can be a slippery little thing,neutral
286,now im writing this review on my kindle fire hdagainst all odds and autocorrects fierce attempts to insert something deliciously inappropriate into it in the middle of the night atam when normal people are asleep and resting so it says something about my devotion we got agb version after our old computer let out its last breath so we wont completely disappear off the map and could have some basic internet access and of course the fact that me and my husbands room started to look like a dementeduncontrollable library with a mind of its own affected the decision tooim trying to be super realistic and it really tormented me to take off one star but the only thing that i can find negative about the kindle is the battery life and it has to be mentioned everything else is absolutely and utterly awesome at least for mei didnt know i would be able to do so much besides reading books on my kindle i seriously didnt expect that muchin fact due to chronic illness my eyesight is so crappy that reading became more and more of a chore and i love readingbut i can easily and without eye strain read on it backlit screen is actually giving some rest to my eyes andshorter pages that are automatically set on kindle make it easier as well i do listen to music on a youtube app we downloaded and videos run smoothly unless our provider is effing around trained a pandora station fairly well to play my favourite bands and finally figured out how to properly facebook on it at first i couldnt even figure out how to read comments or even how to find my own bloody page its all fairly intuitive and if even a person like me who proudly carried a flip phone into theand never used a touch screen before can figure it out you can toothe images are crisp games run well weeeell that depends sometimes on the game itself and the developer the sound can be greatly improved with headset which is true for most mobile devices and i still giggle happily like a kid when i zoom in on the illustration in the book and can actually see the detailswhat a cool feature we dont really use it as a camera and its camera isnt honestly that great but will work in a pinch if there is a direneed and yes a snapshot of your dog is dire need people magazines do look fantastic on it so does artwork of any kind i also would avoid email apps entirely maybe its just me but its easier to manage email in the browser i love that settings are easily accessible that once you are near a public network kindle will seamlessly log into it and that it remembers ours when we are getting closer to home the gyroscope can get out of whack if you lie down to read its possible to turn it off the kindle became my constant companion as i wake up and go about my day and whatever internet related need arises i just carry the kindle around check the facebook bank accounts look up a business or an address read the news go through the emails its pretty awesome all around even with fairly heavy walking dead games on it it still has room and you can store all amazon purchased stuff on their cloud server so i intend to keep it that waywith all this awesomeness however comes a drawback thats not a big issue for a person like me whos at home and near the charger most of the time but will really bug those who are on the move even if you are only reading books and listening to music checking bare bones internet avoiding all streaming content including your candy crush whatnot etc the battery still sucks i know the little thing is trying to cope with high definition videos constant wifi connection its a lot to ask for but i have to charge the little bastardtwice a day plus a full night charge if i want to use it like a bona fide all around device a streaming movie from say prime will devour the battery almost entirelythat said i still love my kindle i baby it terribly its got a matching case and a long ss charger cord that sadly only works when you position it just right insert it just so and dont breathe on it hmm that came out wrong and you did it all by yourself smiles the autocorrectbut for the sake of beauty skys the limit so i hope my kindle lives a long happy life it certainly makes both me and my hubby happy playing games on it that is when we are not fighting over whose turn it is on the kindle hehe,neutral
287,the keyword to remember is that this is an amazon fireas ininch hd this means that the table is exclusive to amazon and integrates perfectly with amazon and amazon kindle as in amazon ebook reader this was an upgrade for me from the original fireand im pleased with the size and hardware specs given that my expectations was to have an amazon fire hdinch tablet that in integrated with amazon and kindle reader much better for me to read in bed as it is lighter in weight and i can hold in one hand comfortably since the background of the reader can be adjusted for low light conditions as well as changing font and font size its perfect ebooks purchased through amazon are not only stored on the device but are also available through device management under the account although i have never ran out of storage space for my ebooks i know i can remove any book ive read and download another if i want to reread a book i simply redownload it to my fire the web browser is smooth and responsive the touch is not as responsive as i had hoped for in a new version of amazons software but it is better than the original fire i am hoping the touch screen can be updated through an update in the near future for those of you with the expectation of a more expensive full functioning tablet you will need to drop abouttimes more money than the very reasonably price amazon fire hdat the price point ofbucks for those of you with the expectations for a very capable ebook reader with the ability to easily and conveniently shop at amazon check email surf the web play a couple of games this is a perfect solution the size also make it small enought for a purse or backpack withoutweight becoming an issue,positive
288,octim dropping my review fromstars tostars for three reasons charge time is very long even with aamp charger it takestohours for a charge then the battery time is not that great either the interface is just not as friendly as ios or android amazon makes this interface oriented toward their media rather than general tablet use weve run into several situations where there apps we desire to load on this tablet but they are not available nor is there any equivalent available too limitedwe find that when we want to look something up on the internet such as weather or news we grab our smart phones rather than the fire tabletat this point i dont recommend the fire hdtablet perhaps the most attractive thing about it is the low price but eventually you forget the cost and are left with the limited feature setoriginal reviewwe are not a tablet family at least not a standard type of tablet such as an ipad or samsung galaxy tab we tend to use either our smartphone or laptop and dont find an inbetween size device without a physical keyboard very interesting however the fire was attractive for one reasonwe can use the overdrive app to download free books from the local library overdrive isnt available on any tablets other than firenow that we have it it will get some use both as a book reader and for general purpose media consumption if it werent for the overdrive requirement we either wouldnt have a tablet or we would buy an android based tablet which would be more flexibleas it is thistablet is decent for the pricepros very sharp screen with good resolution snappy response lightweight small enough to hold it comfortably in one hand access to lots of free media when combined with a prime account the speaker isnt good but better than i thought based on other user commentscons crappy cameras but we dont care as we doubt we would use that feature much if at all user interface unique to amazon one more thing to learn lack of some apps that are available for ios or android no microsd card slot or gpsbut i knew this going in,neutral
289,i really like this tablet i have several tablets nexusregular ipad ipad mini and they are too big to hold while reading books this one is perfect it is the th generation one fromso please take the time to install all the updates i am mad i did not find out about this thing sooner it is the perfect size to put in my purse which is what i wanted if you are looking for a great reader tablet this is the one to get i am a prime member and the music is awesome i can add songs to my library and download them to my fire it also has the lyrics very happy with my purchase,positive
290,i originally bought this for my brother he has an upper extremity physical disability and didnt get used to it so he gave it back to me right about the time when my old nd generation kindle fire died after nearlyyears of good service im sorry but this is not nearly as good and its mostly about the touchscreen responsiveness my old fire was as good as an ipad whereas this one is not as fast and sensitive i would return it if i used it for serious stuff but my needs areentertainmentbooks magazines video and musicso its adequate i wouldnt buy it again,neutral
291,i have to be honest and say i was very skeptical when i purchased this fire hdeverything i was worried about is a distant memory in my view this tablet is so much more than you would think atablet would be so much more indeed the size is also just perfect for what i need i can keep it in my pants pocket i can keep it in my back pants pocket i can also keep it in my vest pocket i recomend this or any amazon product because they are solid sturdy products that amazon stands behind almost to the point that it seems like it would embarrass them if they sold a defective product i know that sounds silly but thats the impression i get,neutral
292,i got this today and im super unhappy with it i did not want the ads you get its slow and does not work very well this is nothing more then a joke in a box if i could give itstars i would what a waste ofbucks with shipping and tax you can only use amazons apps and if you try and install any other app it gives you a screen to buy coins etci will never again buy this or any thing like it from amazon,neutral
293,as an owner of thefire hd i was pretty impressed with the smallerfire i loved the more compact size the two cameras and the screen graphics are vivid and crisp the browser is a lot better and most of the specs on the new fire were better in general than thefire except for the sound i was very very disappointed that the sound coming out of the speaker was so awful my galaxyhas a much better speaker and the volume comes up much louder than thefire i compared it to my old fire and the old fire sounds like a boom box compared to the new one i will only be able to listen to it with headphones on since you can barely hear any quality sound if not for this issuei would have given itstars,positive
294,i absolutely love my fire tablet at first i was daunted by how small the tablet is compared to apple tablets or other kindle fires but the small size makes it easy to carry around with me everywhere i mainly use my tablet for my kindle books so to me the best feature by far is the blue shade button which converts the screen lighting during dark hours this reduces the amount of headaches i used to get from staring at the bright white screen,neutral
295,i have to say i like the form factor of the kindle voyage better thin light weight more square than rectangular but the fire tablet while heavier and thicker has many software and user experience advantages such as the ability to consume all media types including streaming video the kindle reader app lets you change the page color offers more font options and pagination features ive used many kindles and android tablets but i find that i read longer and am more engaged with the voyage because of the light weight,positive
296,a big step up from my original kindle with its hd screen and bright colorsfor the first time ever i can actually see figures maps charts whatever the book throws at methis does come at a pricea more quickly discharging battery but i intend to use it only for reading so i can manage the battery lifevery easy to set up and easy to share accounts with a family member with a different kindleabsolutely no complaints,positive
297,the fire hd exceeded my expectationsim really happy with the camera that theyve added to this onethe video quality is greati feel the sound couldve been a little bit better didnt seem to have the quality that my original one hadi wouldve given it five stars except for the fact that eight gigs is just not enough to hold everything that i want to doi always seem to be running out of space and i have no extra space for videos that id like to savethe microphone on the keyboard is an added advantage to me as i dont like to type on the screenthis size fits more easily into my pursei think its just a wonderful little device,positive
298,i was unsure of this when i ordered itbut now that i have it and i have used it i love it i solely use it for reading books its perfect and literally the size of a paperback book i highly suggest it for bookworms such as myself if you do wonder if you can use this for games and such yes it has a quiet time feature that you turn on to keep apps and such from interrupting you its very useful,positive
299,i really like my new fire hdwe are apple people just because thats what my husband was given by his employersbut since our kids had taken over my ipad i thought for the price why not try itpleasantly surprisedits nicer to read on than my phone and games are easier to seethat said theis small but for what i wanted it fits the billthe display is amazingthe biggest drawback is that it works very different from our apple products so its probably going to be too hard for my disabled son to transition from an ipad to a firebut as a positive this makes this fire all mine,neutral
300,i bought this with the intention of using it mainly for reading comics and graphic novels and im very disappointed in the quality of kindles panel viewit should make each panel cover most of the screen and instead it barley enlarges each panel or even worse sometimes it enlarges half or full page at a time making it impossible or incredibly hard to readthe overall experience of panel view is horrible you miss all of the details in the art and trying to navigate the panels is slow glitchyi know there is comixology but the dont carry dark horse which isof what i read plus the app for the kindle has gotten horrible reviews and their prices are the same or higher than if you just bought the real thingso basically its a very regrettable purchasei should have returned it right away,negative
301,this six inch kindle fire is my favorite tabletand i own seven kindle fires and many other brands including samsung lg and apple the size is larger than an iphoneplus but smaller than anytablet and fits in an adults palms comfortablyyes you can hold this with one hand and type with another just like you would with a smartphone the screen is excellent with a higher resolution than the current regular line of seven inch tablets by amazon except the hdx series the display has over a million pixelsppixand is considered hd i find the videos and pictures very clear and does not bother my eyes even with prolonged use at a time the speed is above average relative to other tablets not as fast as apples but then this is a fraction of the cost all my favorite apps including netflix and youtube works very well had to simply download from amazon apps for free the battery life is about six hours straight streaming video the sound is not the loudest but audible enough for me indoors the camera is very decent and can take from both front and back the fitfinish is excellent and when i weighed this on a scale it read atounces at this current price of under a hundred dollars there is simply no match and this fits in my jacket pockets comfortably,positive
302,needed something small besides ipad air and this cute little sturdy machine does the job really nicely very good picture resolution and colors reasonably fast movies look great onemail works very well basically a fantastic tablet for the truly fantastic low price the only negatives it does feel a bit heavy for its size but you get used to it in no time and some silk web browser issues navigation sometimes tricky because of smaller buttons flickering sites or embedded video sometimes wouldnt open all very minor issues compared to all it does super well love it get it,positive
303,i was skeptical in getting a tablet just because i didnt think i needed another gadget but i am really glad i didthis fire has a camera so i can skype with my friends my laptop doesnt have onealso this will be perfect for vacationsi have already addedbooks and will only have to carry this small tableti got pink and its a really pretty pinkvery pleased,positive
304,this is the perfect sizei got the g with special offerswish they had a memory slot which is why i went with the g i was concerned that the special offers would be intrusive and looked at all the info out there on ways to disable it just in case well all my concerns on the special offers were overblown the only time i really see it is when i open my fire and slide it out of the way a few times it did catch my attention the other place it shows up is amazon apps i think other than the screensaver you dont see any adsfinally i joined the dark side amazon ecosystem now i can use my amazon prime video amazon you should fix your prime video apps as all my devices including computer and tv it doesnt work this is the only way i can watch prime at all all those other devices you have to jump thru hoops to sign up click on links pretty much irritating procedures and aftermins you still cant watch prime well now i can on my amazon fire hd now i browse the prime video library and download it so i can watch it when i dont have wifithe fire hdis the perfect size for me larger than phones smaller than my other tablets about the size of a pocket book now all i need is a hdmi adapter for this to watch prime on my tvbtw the new fire is out and more features if you dont mind it in ainch version it has has a sd slot for increased storage and less than half the price i paid for this had this come out when i decided to buy i would not buy at all until they came out with ainch with sd slot other than mine not having a sd slot im pretty happy with it especially since i can finally watch prime videos,negative
305,its a good tablet but i didnt want a tableti wanted a kindle ereader with text to speech ability like ive always had on my beloved kindlesince the new kindle ereaders dont have text to speech i had to get the fireas a ereader it is not nearly as good as the old kindlethe screen glares makes it impossible to read outside and makes my eyes hurt after a few hoursalso books and collections are harder to get toif amazon would bring back the kindle ereader with text to speech i would definitely get one and only use the fire as a tabletvery frustrating,neutral
306,pros good for reading your kindle library great experience shopping on amazon videos look crisp and play quality is great cons ads on lock screen silk browser is slow not as many apps available as android and ipad battery doesnt last as long as i expectedi bought the fire hdon amazon prime day i was looking for a small tablet to use for reading and surfing the web i do not use a ton of apps on my smartphone and i am not a mobile game person so i cant speak too much to those features its easy to set up you basically open the box turn it on and its easy to walk through from there i enjoy it for reading my kindle library and watching videos i really dislike the silk browser and would prefer to use chrome but i dont think it is compatible silk browser is slow and clunky the fire is pretty small but i was not looking for a huge screen it can get heavy to hold after a while and gets warm to the touch if you are watching videos for a while the battery did run out faster than i expected but i have not yet set up any power management settingsoverall it does what i wanted and i am happy with my purchase,neutral
307,let me start by saying this was purchased as an emergency replacement of an awesome kindlewe have had for a little overyears droppedtoo many times screen explodedduring the time weve had theour youngest child who is autistic had made it his own and carries it around everywhere like a teenager with a smartphone until the battery dies at which time he usually calmly hands it over to get rechargedwhile he was taking a nap one of his siblings dropped it and when he awokeunless you have a young autistic child you wouldnt understand the unstopable display of unhappinessobviously having children we use the free time appthrough a bit of research i finally found out that it doesnt work the same way it did on theall the apps loaded onto a childs profile kept disappearing whenever you leave the profile until the parental controls are enabled even though everything in the parental controls are turned off read about turning off educational settingsnow even though that part is fixed there are a handful of books that keep reappearing even though i keep doing the remove from carouseland since it gets used until the battery dies when it is recharged the child profile is empty until you exit and then when you return it is full of little gray squares it takes aboutminutes of playing with it before the gray squares finally become tiles for the appsand as a side note thewas purchased without special offers but thewas only available with special offersi wish it wasnt an emergency special offers are more annoying than they say they will be,neutral
308,well its a kindle so of course its greatthis is my fourth kindle so how this compares to others will be included in my reviewmy regularkindle not hd nd generation has been greati wouldnt have purchased a new one at all since i have been so satisfied with it but i dropped it outside on a pebble laden driveway and the screen crackedsadnessi was glad to be able to pick a different color other than black and have been pleased and disappointed with a couple of differences in this one over my lastwhile it is touted as hd so far i cant tell any difference in definition but perhaps within some apps that mattersi just havent discovered that yetim sure theres a benefit to hd that i will discover later such as streaming videoboth my devices have ads which arent a painthe unit is usually cheaper if you get the one with ads or offers as they describe itthe offers always show up on the locktimeout screen and anytime ive been interested in the offer it goes away once i password back inno idea where the offer goes but i never go searching around online for itthats the only time ive ever received an offerad so it isnt a pain for mei love the camera and microphone which is new to me with kindlethe screen even at only one inch smaller my previous wasand this iswill work but seems considerably smaller than myi upgraded to the gb data for onlymore and that will be greatmy previous one had so much on it that i had to use cloud storage and load and unload apps constantlythat isnt good for some apps because you lose your progress on games or your saved locations on gps apps etcoverall this is a much more robust device with twice the memory and all the great things you can do with it besides readingone last awesome feature is that you get free unlimited cloud storage so you can offload your pictures apps books music etc and load them back when you need them so you get to save tons of space on your device,positive
309,i received my new kindlethe other dayshipping wasday deliveryive had a kindle hdforyears but it has started to freeze up even after resetting it so i thought it was time to look for another small tabletthis one is perfect for my needsfits right into my hand and pursethe camera is handy to have for quick picturesi bought the moko slim folding cover case for it which works very wellit wakes the kindle up and when you close it puts it to sleepso if you are looking for a nice little tablet for a good price this is the one to pick,positive
310,best tablet deali own an ipad minibut wanted something smaller to carry in the cargo pants pocket sometimesipad minifits inside a cargo pants pocket but not completely the velcro lid cannot closeis the perfect size for the pocketnow the screen resolution cannot match that of ipad mini but the color is very contrasty and goodconsidering the price black friday deal this has to be the best tablet dealandroid os has improved a lot and its pretty close to the apples user friendlinessvery portable and inexpensive,positive
311,takesminutes to connect to any wifi signal other devices are using the same signal and having no problem but this fire takes foreverminutes was clocked three times in a row it took that long to verify my acceptance of the terms then anotehrrminutes to download one book with amazons customer service right up there on par with dell im not optimistic,neutral
312,before i go on i should point out that the unit i used was a refurbished specimen purchased from amazonthe device seems pretty well made there was a bit of adhesive for the screen at the bezel but beyond that the unit was sound it is much heavier and thicker than i would expectthough the screen is pretty small at this dimension it is clear and sharp whether it be reading an ebook or watching videos it can be quite bright brightness varies a lot from the reading vs video app the video from amazon was dim and i needed to dial up the brightness considerablythe interface is much more androidy than the kindle i had a few years ago and i think this is generally a good thing the other androidy thing is that it is relatively easy to load the play store on the kindle and those apps that i use from device to device worked well for me like outlook the native amazon apps have improved as well with an acceptable mail client and a calendar that was ok though i had to specify device settings on the google calendar remote device management page otg cable function worked just finereally the big deal breaker for me is the battery life which was abysmal using mixed reading and video i might have gottenhours out of the device which makes it very limited in use for longer trips and this was in airplane mode on and the screen brightness reduced as much as tolerable whether this is a realistic trade off for the low price is up to the user i suppose but finding the device less useful than a gennexusboth in speed and battery life gives me little reason to keep the device either as an e reader or media consumption device the kindle and amazon video apps on these other devices make the proprietary importance of having a marginally useful tablet questionable for me it is worth having longer battery life and a faster processor at a higher price,positive
313,i like it i really do but i also hate it the constant ads pulling up on my lock screen are ridiculous as others have mentioned also i think all the extra ads slow it down im not sure but mine is not fast at all and the touch screen doesnt always feel my touch if that makes sensei am definitely upset i dont have the option to return it i had high hopes for this,negative
314,this was my defacto smartphone replacement for many years as i resisted getting a new phone was able to do all i wanted and more with this product it made it through a trip to the grand canyon in my pocket and recorded a lot of great photos and video i used it for internet surfing other times the wireless works very well,positive
315,got my hdfrom woot an amazon company as a refurb it came with all the accessories and worked perfectly out of the box to be honest the screen was smaller than i expected but i dont see that as a negative just unexpected ive owned a nd gen fire its usb powersync connector didnt last after less than a year the unit could no longer be charged the hdseems to have corrected that problem overall build quality of the hdis also better than the earlier version picture quality is also better as is touch sensitivity and responsiveness it only hasgb storage but i knew that going in so its not an issue ive owned othergb android devices and understand about app and data management so again its not an issuemy primary use is as a book reader and video playback device it servers both purposes very well in fact i also own an lg gpadlte and video performance on the hdand i enjoy my hdover it with the dolby digital plus it has crisp clear highs and deep resonant bass making audio playback a please to experience whether im listing to classical music pop music music and audio on movies or tv showsi installed the google play store app you jump through a few hoops to do that and now have access to everything from that venue as well i dont play games on my mobile devices so i cant speak to that feature but everything else i want to do with an android tablet is done well on the hd i also own an ipadand iphone plus im not comparing the hdto those devices because i never compare android to ios devices the price and function rage between the two platforms are too different to say one is better than the other however when compared to other android devices ive ownedothers including my lg ill say this quickly became my favorite i like the user interface better than the other android incarnations because its more intuitive and again the fit and finish is up there with units costing many times moreif there is a negative it would be the lack of an external storage slot i would have liked the ability to dump music or video to aorgb memory card to make my media portable but i rarely take my hdaway from the house as such its not a game changer besides i have a plex media server at home so when im not away i can stream my entire media library to my tablet and playback is flawless we cut the cable cable tv that is almost a year ago instead we have netflix hulu crunchyroll dramafever and viki accounts combined with our roku player and plex weve never looked backallinall i have to give twothumbsup for the hdwith good battery life audio and video and the ability to handle everything ive thrown at it i would recommend the hdto anyone looking for a wellbuilt and functional android tablet,neutral
316,i really like my kindle fire hdthe smaller size makes it a little easier to handle than ainch tabletthe screen is nice and bright and it holds a charge welli bought the citron version and it is really pretty,positive
317,bought this for myyear old instead of the new kids edition because it had more options with add on memoryi went with ayear warranty and a heavy duty case just in case and it was still cheaperyou can still set parental controls and add different usersthe free time is awesome and for a few dollars more you can extend it every yearthe sound is awesome and thescreen is the perfect sizemaybe the next generation of the kids edition may be better i went off of reviewsi hope this helpspsshe spends hours on it,positive
318,i have the original kindle fire and i expected this one to work the same way and it didnti have had a terrible time trying to figure out the simplest things such as sending a book to the cloud etcthe charge isnt greaton the plus side the screen is easy to read and it is very light and fits in my handbag easilyif i could figure out some of the simple things i would be really happy except for the length of charge,neutral
319,i really do like this little devicei have an ipad air that does all this device can do and much more but the size and somewhat limited capacity is most appealingi traded my originalinch fire for this one and im extremely pleasedfront and rear camera palm size amazons extensive network easily accessible makes this an unbelievable deal forthe limited capacity is most appealing because it doesnt offer me the mountains of distractions of my ipadwhile it does more than i use it for i find it allows me to focus on particular tasks namely reading,negative
320,i bought this kindle for my son for christmas i was hoping that it would keep him busy for hours however that is not the case he really gets bored with it it doesnt have a lot of memory if there is a video or a few picture youre not able to have many games also i dont like how when the memory is full it turns the wiifii off that was very confusing to us at first i hate that it plays ads i think its ridiculous that you have to pay extra to get the ads taken off the kindle i mean ive already purchased it it should have on it what i chose,negative
321,apples apparent intention to force ipad users to use their ibook app as opposed to the kindle app is backfiring on them at least as far as im concernedmaybe its by design maybe its just plain stupidity but i am more than a little tired of those idiots continually trying to fix what aint brokeat first the kindle app worked beautifullyid just touch on the app and would take me directly to the book i was readingbut must have been too user friendly because with each enhancementimprovement of their operating system the kindle app has become more and more unwieldythank god amazon has the good sense to leave well enough aloneamazons kindle app works just fine thank you and they dont keep trying toimprove itthere are now almost as many apps for the fire as there are for the ipad making the kindle fire an excellent alternativethe price difference is pretty substantial as well in the kindles favorthe only problem ive had is the slot for the mini usb cableit wore out to the point that im unable to power up my old kindle oh well live and learnmy work around for this problem is that i simply dont remove the power cable at that endi leave the power cable connected to the kindle and i disconnect the cable from the usb endits a little awkward reading from the kindle with the power cord just dangling but thats lifei highly recommend the kindle fireill take it over the ipad any day,neutral
322,bought this on black friday last year and its been one of my favorite tech gadgets i use overdrive to check out books from the library do most of my social media on it and play lots of free games plenty of storage for what i need and the battery life is great this was my first tablet and it hooked me i have an ipad airthat i use for work but i really like the size of the fire for reading and games,neutral
323,first the upsidenice tablet with a truly crystal clear display comfortable size to hold and its very pocket friendlythe display was extremely glossy so you might want to consider an antiglare free screen protectornow the down sidethe fire hdseems designed for the person that lives in the cloudunless you have easy and free access to the internet it falls short on usabilityin my opinioni bought it for use on vacations and trips but without access to the outside world it seems to have very limited use because youre stuck with less thangb total of onboard storage and that includes the os and the applicationsthere is no microsd slot you cant expand the memory and it doesnt support usb otg so you cant even plug in an external thumb drivethis was clearly designed for the user that does everything in the cloud whether it be from amazon or the other guysout of the box it had abattery charge which quickly dropped toduring the two hours i had it turned oni thought i was not using any battery hog application so i cant explain the quick dischargebutif you live in the cloud and can keep the battery chargednice little unit,positive
324,the color citron is more yellow than it appears in the photo which is a good thing to me the screen is large the device full of great features kindle books email facebook youtube calendar contact syncing capabilities free time for kids and so much more and it is very easy to figure out and use i really appreciate the ability to open multiple windows on the browser shop online and still read my favorite books on the go this is an awesome device for a great price,positive
325,i was unsure about this product when i first got i could not think of a reason to get it until i needed a phone and this was supposed to have a free texting app which i have not been able to get it to work yet and down loaded books for school however it is like a mini computer and i tend to go to that before my computer i love it i can watch tv apps download free books listen to pandora and of course games this was a birthday present to myself and i love it,positive
326,a solid product and a very adequate tablet for making use of streaming though the lack of a youtube app on the amazon app store is infuriating some light web browsing and of course a perfect size for reading thought ideally would be a little lighter its a brick but a functional one that i cant complain about given the price and it has served me very well i have been reading a lot more ever since i got this,neutral
327,i purchased this with the special offersi have since paid to have the special offers removedthey showed up on everything that i did on the tablet and my grandchildren kept selecting things that popped up so it was difficult to keep them going on anythingit is much better now that the special offers have been removed,neutral
328,this is not as durable as advertised in the commercial in which a lady leaves the kindle on the roof of her car and as she pulls out of the drive way she has to make a sudden stop and the kindle slides from the car crashes on to the ground and a nice young man picks it up and hands to the lady with nosignificant damage this is complete false advertising i just bought a kindle that is supposed to provide that same durabilityi bought this for my five year old thinking with the promise of increased durability it would handle a few dropsjust today my son did just that from about a foot off the groundby far not as high as shown in the commercial the screen shatteredwhen i called amazon expecting a replacement base on the claim of durability i was told since i did not not purchased a extended warranty that it would not be replacedi feel completely cheatedthe kindle is less then two weeks old if you are considering buying this for a youngchild i would not recommend it,neutral
329,i had the first kindle fire when it came out i loved it this new kindle fire hdbothers me because its so small the graphics arent that great and the memory thing is a huge issue for me i understand the kindle only cost mebut i mean cmon is it not for downloading and reading books with all the preloaded things i downloaded one book and was out of space for apps thats ridiculous thats why i givestars,negative

336,and you should not expect it to be that said i bought my kindle fire hdon clearance for an unbelievable price of onlyi wanted a second smaller device to keep around to read my kindle books on at work i got thegig as it was the only one the store was deeply discounting i would gave preferred thegig version i also got the special offers ifor one like them i have already gotten two really book book suggestions and one movie suggestion frankly i do not understand what all the fuss is about over the ads they are on the home screen for what amounts to a few seconds if you hate them that much just pay the fee to remove them the resolution is not as good as my ipad minii did not expect it would be as i paidfor my minivsfor the fireit is still very good though this fire hdwill mainly be used for reading books listening to my audible books and looking for new books on amazon what it will not be used for is facebook candy crushor other games twitter skype or used as a camera as long as you keep in mind the phrase it is what it is you cant go wrongyou really need to know just what this tablet can and cant do you also need to define just what your needs are and how best to meet them i think too many people think they are going to spendand walk away with an ipad quality tablet you wont what you will get is a lot of bang for the buck if possible go to an electronics store and compare the kindle fire hdto an ipad mini or any other tablet you might be considering and see whichtablet will best suit your needs and go from there,neutral
337,so far the device is perfect for my purposesscreen is great and i cant find may faultsis that i cant run my nook app on this thing i really enjoyboth and amazon blocking it seems pettythe other is that the blue shade app isnt on this device i was really looking forwrd to trying that and its a serious disappointmentwhen is it coming to this thing,neutral
338,i should prefix this by saying that no member of my family kids included engage in any kind of social media activitywith that said we bought a tablet and generally all we do with it is stream music and my kids watch some videos once in a blue moon and for our application this is perfectthe bluetooth works very well i dont know what the range is because it sits right next to the stereomy only complaint if there is a complaint to be had is that the battery life leaves a little bit to be desiredfor our purposes this is the best option we are not computer tech people so this was very easy and intuitiveill admit that some of the settings are difficult to locate but by using the search feature we have found what we needed in the settings with easeby way of comparison my brother bought thetablet vs this one and well i would say this is worth the extra money well worth the extra moneywe found after trying out theamazon tablet that it leaves more than a little bit to be desired,neutral
339,i love the size of the fire but i am finding that the charge runs out quickly the charge will go fromtojust from reading a book for an hour not sure if it is a defective item or if i need to do something to conserve the battery life if this is normal for these tablets then that seems to take the portability aspect out of the equation if it needs to be plugged in continuously otherwise i am happy with the product,positive
340,ive always been skeptical of tablets but thought id give the firea try because they were on sale i am pleasantly surprised with this little gadget it has a lot more speed than i expected its really convenient because of the compact size i like to stream my music and podcast on it its easy to connect to the internet theres tons of apps that can be downloaded it easy to use and handy to have especially when i dont feel like waiting on my computer to boot up i wish the charging port were in a different spot or it had more than one because it interferes with my case all in all this is a good buyi received this item at a discounted price or for free in return for my honest and unbiased review after testing and using the product the views expressed here are my own in my own words and are based on my own experience with and use of the item i am in no way required or influenced by the seller to leave a positive review and i stand by my review ratings as i make sure to give a rating that matches my experience with the product if you have found my review to be helpful in making a decision about this product please make sure to vote yes in response to whether my review was helpful,positive
341,this is my third kindle fire my second fire hdi really like the new platform all apps and content are organized in an efficient and effective easy to use manner this tablet is arguably the very finest for its relatively low cost,positive
342,customer service is a complete joke i purchased four of these for my kids when the screen broke on one i bought a new one to replace it all i wanted to do is transfer data including apps from the old device to the new one the problem was not just that customer service was not able to help me they were not even able to understand what i wanted the representative took me through two or three long processes before i realized he was doing something completely different than what i wanted when i explained it to him for the third or fourth time he said he was not able to help me and needed to transfer me to someone else at that point i asked to speak to a supervisor whom i could to be equally unhelpful,neutral
343,i dont have much to say and most other reviewers have already expressed the way i feel about this kindle i will say amazon has hit home run with this kindle if you are reading this and mainly own a computer for internet use do yourself a favor and buy this kindle its more portable compact and power efficient than any laptop out there throw that old clunker away and jump into the new age of digital streaming you will not be disappointed,neutral
344,i bought the kindle fire so that i could purchase ebooks and have them read to me with texttospeech using the kindle fire the android app lacks this featurei want to listen to audio in my car as i have been with my phonei have the fire plugged into a usb charger that turns onoff with the cari have found the fire frustrating for the following reasons it doesnt reliably sync up to my bluetooth device like my phone does i have to turn the bluetooth off and on on the fire to get it to sync up the screen comes on when i start my car due to usb power coming on and when im driving if the display switches orientation eg when stepping on the brakes then the texttospeech pausesi have to be sure to turn the display off after i start my car when i turn off my car the fire display wakes up and it loses connection with my bluetooth deviceinstead of pausing the texttospeech it continues to read and i need to click on the pause button the controls on my bluetooth receiver dont workwith my phone i could rewindsec pause scan by chapters etcwith the fire these controls dont work in a useful wayas amazon does not support texttospeech with their android app this is a real let down that the fire doesnt have a car mode,neutral
345,i had the first version of the kindle fire and it was not that great this one on the other hand is really cool especially for the price i only really use it for reading books and streaming netflix i occasionally go on facebook ebay andamazon apps but thats only every now and thenthis think streams netflix really well and the resolution is great bestbucks i spent in,positive
346,this is a very nice tablet for the moneyi have used a bunch of tablets looking for something that is cheap enough to not fret if it dies or gets lost in my classroom but has the horsepower and quality to do what i need it to do for some ridiculous reason i tried several cheap tablets before i realized that fire hdhas a rear camera plenty of memory and looked like it supported the apps that i use in my practice as a classroom teacherso i rolled the dice and got one it came in today and i put it though its paces setup is embarrassingly easy and the interface is clean and simple i was able to download the apps in no time and they passed my acid test this is a test that the underbuck tablets i tried earlier failed miserably at so this is already a winnerthen i noticed the externals the fit and finish is very nice the tablet is smalli thought this would be a problem but it really works for me sometimes the big is better mentality hobbles you the glass is gorilla glass and the plastic case seem to be pretty durable i did get a case heavy duty case to go with it and will install it tomorrowthe case is the one that is bundled as a recommended seti am using this as a teaching tool and i am thrilled i really need to think of amazon as a solid option for hardware more often while their emphasis on hardware is a platform to deliver their content they really are committed to doing it right i was an early adapter for the kindle one of the first to get one of the first fires and again with the fire tv why i waited so long to get one of the new tablets is beyond mei went with thegb version with the ad screen saverit wasnt worth the extrabucks or so for me to get rid of the advertising,neutral
347,i bought this for my preschool though athe is still too young for a lot of things i decided on a kindle because i knew it was something that would grow with my child unlike those kids tablets like leap pad on first impression i noticed that for something so small it was incredibly heavy it almost hurts my wrist to hold it and i cant image its very easy for my child to hold you can also tell that one end is heavier than the other the first time we used it it got quite warm but i havent noticed it being a big problem the display is fantastic and everything looks very clear and brightly colored the only problem i have with the screen is that the glare seems to be even worse than my iphone or ipad it is pretty easy to set up and use myyear old figured out how to hit the back and home buttons in less than a day very user friendly however if you are used to ios it will take a little adjusting to i spent a few days playing around with freetime unlimited i suggest theday free trial to decide if it will work for you and your child i personally dont think its all that worth it though it did give me the chance to test a few games before purchase to make sure i would like them we are going to just use the regular profile there were a few things i didnt like about the standard profilei dont like that you cant remove some of the preinstalled apps that you might not have any use for but there were still fewer than what comes preloaded on some other tabletsthe videos was a big issue for me if my child opens videos they see the video store instead of just our content in order to view our content you have to click a menu icon and then click on your video library this concerns me because i dont want anything accidentally purchased and also makes it more difficult for a younger person to find however once a video has been opened it will appear in the carousel so as long as you leave it there your child could still find it easy enough since this is going to be for a child i decided to purchase the kindle wout special offers to me this was well worth the extra price i dont need anything purchased or for my child to see something i dont want them to seeoverall i think this is going to be a good table for him as he grows up there are lots of educational apps and videos i can load as a homeschooling mom i think having this is going to be wonderful,positive
348,only had it a few months and its nothing but a huge problem if i could get my money back i would in a heart beat constant glitches and having to restore it constantlyupdateit seems that the skyping methods just went out as well just keeps getting worse for the kindle,neutral
349,i bought this recently to replace my aging firstgen kindle the price was unbeatable and i loved it fast compact and great soundpicture i updated through the x os but when it hit osit became horrible full of ads and bloatware thankfully amazon allows you to roll back to oswhich i did i am very happily runningthis gets a four rather than a fivestar review for the fact that osis such utter garbage do not use it,neutral
350,im quite disappointed in this product as well as the service for the product to begin the screen would often freeze requiring a complete shut down and reboot to get it to work frustrating but easy to deal with then more recently the kindle took a tumble off of ainch tall endtable where it cracked the glass nowi understand that the cracks were because it slipped off the table due to our own negligence however this product is advertised and marketed as being more durable than an apple product the commercials for the fire show it being dropped down wooden stairs as well as sliding off of the top of a car onto a road simply put ive had my iphone for several years and it has taken a tumble once or twice with no damage the kindle took one and the screen cracked i called customer service and was immediately told that my warranty on the device is now void and that they could offer me a discount on the device yet i could purchase a replacement for a price higher than i originally paid and that you can get on the website i wasnt expecting anything for the kindle i was simply curious what was covered so not a huge deal the attitude and service i received was not typical of amazon which is quite surprising i personally would not recommend this product for its durability as is advertised yes the device is cute and easy to use but there are still technical glitches to be worked out and a better approach to their marketing of a durable product that is not as durable as they claim,neutral
351,i love it i traded in a kindle paperwhite black and white to upgrade to color the color is fantastic if you are going to be downloading any books or magazines with color photos you wont be disappointed,positive
352,easy to useclear resolution as i use my fire tablet mainly for reading the browser is easy to use for internet searchfits nicely in my pursei tote it around with me the vast majority of timemy disappointment is with the sound without earphonesvery tinny and weak volume even with sound on high i paired with a bluetooth speaker and i have earbuds to solve problem as i listen to music and audiobooks,neutral
353,havent quite figured out how to use it since i got it last night but it came early and i could not wait to use itgreat so fari like finding the free books on here to readi am so used to being able to customize my stuffi am quite sure you can but havent gotten that far yetjust wish it had a booklet on the how to but i guess for most they already know how to use one it is user friendly so not too much of a worry,positive
354,when i am out of the office i need to check email and go to certain web sites for information and so far it all works better than expectedbefore i purchased it i found out i could download chrome but so far the silk browser works everywhere i need to goi checked all the coffee shops fast food places and restaurants around the county and they all have free wifi connections which were easy to connect from the parking loteven the marina where i kept my boat last summer has free wifi so i can stay in touch like my job requiresthefire is the perfect pocket size tablet fits in my cargo pant pockets or coat pockets or back pocketif it was larger it would not be as convenient to carry but it is still big enough to read easily so far it is a good fit for what i need and the more i use it the better i like it the calendar feature requires me to register an email address and password which i do not want to do so i think i will find an app that does not require thati have had it a week this is my first tablet and it is so intuitive that i had it up and running in a matter of minutesi am thinking my wife will like the same unit for her pursei did not sign up for prime so i can not comment on that,positive
355,im sad to see this is selling so well and has such high ratings my experience has been the total opposite of what everyone else here has hadinitially i thought perhaps my inexperience with using this could have been the source of my problems i even ordered a replacementwhich was shippedjust before receiving the replacement i did mange to record a video that was actually over a minute or two so stupidly i thought i had licked the problem and sent the replacement back unopened i should have kept the replacementbut felt bad about it since i was under the impression that it was my error why the camera seems to not workas soon as i returned the new unit my original went back to its old tricks namely it shuts off after a minute orevery single time i attempt to film anything buying this to record videos on the run was my only reason for buying this being able to get on the internet was secondary but a nice plus to have when i wasnt homesince i dont own a smartphoneafter a minute or so of filming without warning it stops recording and a screen pops up telling me that in order to connect to wifi i have to enter a password hell im not making any attempt to get on the internetmy fingers arent even on the unit when this message pops up im just tying to film some video i have now missedmajor life events that wont come around again i should have never trusted this unitsince i bought this unit i have lost my job ofyears and cannot afford to go out and purchase a portable video recorder that actually works had i been able to i probably wouldnt have even written this negative review i would just buy another product that works i have to wonder if this hasnt happened to other folks who just threw their units away and purchased something that does worki have been supporting amazon pretty much since the day they came online but in my book they goofed majorly on this product,neutral
356,the fire hdis the best budget tablet by far with this price point you cant really expect much more with a smooth interface and and a great screen the amazon fire doesnt do much wrong and what it does do wrong can be easily exploited what im talking about of course is the fact that this droid wont be coming with the google play store but after watching a simple tutorial which if anyone wants a link leave a comment i got all my paid droid apps running in no time but how is the fire without the assist of google its different yet similar it feels like a droid it kinda looks like your normal droid but youre much more limited but not in a bad way and the apps store is really nice a fluid as well and amazon underground is greatly appreciated with allowing you to download many mainstream games absoulutely free and as sure as hell do they mean it games like sonic dash that rely on you making microtransactions to progress have been scaled down so you can actually get some rings and make some progress overall this is a really great tablet and if you are tight on cash and want some awesome tech here it is oh i forget to mention that after you install google play pokemon go does work with a couple of graphics issues if you care to know please commentnote i bought this device used forday shipping great deal,neutral
357,screen is delayed super frustrating even using the keyboard camera quality is literally a joke the first one i got only after a few months just went off one day for no reason forcing me to pop off the back and rip out the battery having to pop it back in after every slightest bumpthen after doing this for a month or so it finally went completely unresponsiveordered a second one thinking my first must have been a dud sadly this one is worse showed up in package covered in dirtwhen i opened it i got the feelingthat it wasnt new i got the white one and there were significant marks on the back one even looking like a red pen mark then after turning it on i noticed something wrong with the screen a smudge looking blue mark thats there all the time like it has been damaged really my boyfriend got me this one and im so disappointed despite all of these flaws ive decided to keep it but ill never make this mistake again wtf,negative
358,this is the perfect size with great features i can easily adjust the screen settings for reading outside or in complete darkness the blue shade option is probably my favorite because i read a lot at night this has been the best investment ive made on my journey to read more fast processing and userfriendly layout make finding and using apps and settings easy the os is similar to other oss i have used making this transition virtually painless,positive
359,i had the eight inch fire before this onelove bothi like this one more because it easily fits in my pocket even though it is a lot heavier than a regular kindle readerat a moments notice i can switch from reading a book to checking email or surf the web,positive
360,i went from an oldermodel that died to this one and absolutely love it the picture is great of course since its hd but the smaller compact size makes it easier for me to bring around with me,positive
361,i am so happy with my new kindleit almost makes me glad that my old one got ripped off in a hotelthe size is perfectnot a whole lot bigger than an iphone s plusit fits beautifully in my purseit has such a clear nice screenvery easy to set up from my account tooi highly recommend,positive
362,as soon as i saw these announced i had to get one i have and have had plenty oftablets the kindle fire tablets have always been reliable pieces of hardware but ive never liked reading on them due to their screen size i had to try the fire i received it almostweeks ago and i am extremely pleased it is wonderful as a reader the kindle app is excellent and i also use scribd and moon reader on it it is the perfect tablet for reading i have played a few games on it they are fine too i havent tested video or other streaming as i dont do them often anyhowive just ordered two more for my girls for christmas one citron one cobalt both gb they are going to love the cameras that is the main reason i am getting them as well as for the kindle tablet edition games we have which wont play on their nook hd tablets with gorilla glass screens and square trade warranties they should last also ordered the poetic revolution cases for them for extra protection i want these to lastthe fireis a true winner the size the screen the resolution all excellent perfect size for reading and for taking on the go,positive
363,mine broke after using it a little over a year surprise surprise the warranty has expired i called customer service and they were very supportive but in the end i have to replace the device it has some sort of issue with the port not charging correctly i think ill just opt for another brand device no bueno,neutral
364,very disappointed that i cannot read a book at the beach with this kindle love being able to take picturesselfies and appreciate that i can check emailfacebook while at work without using the company computerbut i cannot see the screen at all outdoors,positive
365,we purchased this kindle for christmas inafter a few months of limited use in a protective case the unit would no longer turn on if you are accustomed to an ipad it will be hard to get used to the clunky os and sluggish operation the best thing going for it is the freetime control for parents that and its price are the most compelling reasons to purchase one amazon is sending a replacement unit free of charge but i really just wish they would refund the money i suppose its unfair to compare this to an ipad but if it truly is a quality device it shouldnt have failed within a year especially considering it was well taken care of if i knew then what i know now i would not have bothered with this,positive
366,i got this as a backup tablet to my ipadi wanted something smaller that i could fit in my purse rather than needing to pack it in its own bagplus it has all of the apps i need for a tabletis it my ipadno its nothowever its a solid tablet at a great price,positive
367,updated review i hate this thing it doesnt hold a charge some apps do not have an escape i have to turn the thing off and on several times to get to the home screen my frustration level is high a huge waste of money do not buybutby my rating you know there will be a but the only way the product will charge is if i use the cord and plug that came with the tablet i used a cord made for kindle products i left it on the charger overnight the charge went fromtowhat this is unacceptable i have a kindle paperwhite failing to charge quickly has never been an issue i did a google search and this is a common problem there are the obvious concerns what happens if i lose the cord what if i dont have the cord with me because of the restriction i have to carry yet another cord around with mecome on amazon fix this problemupdate now that i can charge with the right plug it charges quickly but it doesnt hold a charge very long i have an ipad airi have none of the issues im getting very frustrated,negative
368,for the price this tablet is really great i have been impressed with the picture quality internet speed frontrear facibg camera quality and connections to sites like kindle and goodreads the one big disappointment for me is that the kindleamazon app store is lacking compared to the apple and google play stores i wasnt able to get some of my favorite apps like instagram updated tumblr gmail bing etc that i was familiar with on my previous android tablet there seem to be ways to get google apps onto a kindle fire but i am just not desperate enough yet ha,neutral
369,i absolutely love my kindle fire hdthe processor is super fast and the quality of this product all around can not be beat for the price i owned a nook tablet before getting the kindle as a gift and even though nook was not a bad product it just can not compare with kindle the screen resolution easy set up and quality of this product has won me over,positive
370,great little tabletreaderi bought it because myyear old paperwhite is having a few issuesi like the ability to see color pics when used in a book with the addition of overdrive app i can now borrow books from the library that they dont have kindle copies only epub other than being a little heavier than i expected i am very pleased with my purchase,positive
371,i purchased two of these a little over a year ago for my daughters thenat first it was great until i did not want the amazon free time any longer then the few apps they wanted took up so much space there wasnt much room left for books so we have constantly rotated books and apps on and off the tablet second the memory is way to small my fault for buying the gb so if you want one get the larger memory my youngest has her wifi shut off all the time because it says there isnt enough free space to run it it does this on its own we do not do it now i come to the biggest problem we have had with these the automatic updates it keeps doing randomly to the tablet somehow erases the apps off the device even though under the child content they still show up like they are on it this has been a source of frustration for us repeatedly over the last year as it seems to happen to both tablets but at different times that being said i will think three times as hard before i purchase another fire these are not the first kindles i have purchased i own a paperwhite and an original kindle with the keyboard that i lovei have also purchased a different generation kindle and one of the first fires for my husband who loves them i do love the parental control options on these smaller fires but it is not enough to sway my review into the positive,negative
372,i have a lot of versions of the kindle from the original ereader paperwhite hd and hdx i got thisbecause i wanted compact we distribute our kindles now fire hd thru our non profit reads and deeds to kids and i wanted to see how this one worked because the lower the price the more units we can distribute my first reaction is its too heavy once i got beyond that its a great productgreat screen color very smooth moving around the screen movies show up great i have no other complaints nice to have color options i made use of those in my nd and rd order i placed for gifts magenta,positive
373,what a great little tableti have theand theinch ones and each one is unique but very familar and similar in featurestheinch is wide enough to comfortably play games and watch videos yet small enough to hold fairly comfortably in your handreading on this is really comfortable also as it is the size of a lot of books so it is just rightthe sound on all fires is very very good and this is a feature i love about the fireresolution excellent very clear and crisp videos photosgames and reading thanks to the amazingly sharp resolutioncamera quality the camera quality is just ok in my opinion not great not terrible thisin fire comes with front facing camera only which is cool for video chatting and selfiesease of reading kindle fire reading quality is top of the line on all the devices you can make the print as large as you need and its the closest you can get to physically turning the pages yourself as i mentioned the resolution is clear and crisp with anti glare technology so that you can read with ease even outside gb is more than enough for a pretty good number of books and apps though if you are a heavy app user you may want to getorif available as i am not sure on thatoverall a great andpowerful tablet well worth the low pricing ofwithout a doubt,neutral
374,i have the hdx and i works great but i bought the fire hd as a gift for my bf and it has malfunctioned the tablet turns off randomely and the keyboardwhen you type it types nonsense this is withmonths use i dont know whats the matter with it,positive
375,i have wanted a kindle for as long a i can remember and kept putting it off and putting it off until i recently had the chance to try one out in exchange for my honest opinions and i honestly have no idea why i waited so longthis little device is not huge by any means but it is a few times bigger than my phone yet not too big that it takes up too much space it is perfect for slipping into my shoulder bag and as an avid reader this has increased my intake of literature threefold in just the past weeki love that the display is so clear and easy to navigate i also love that there are so many accessible apps on the kindle that it can keepme busy for hours at a time my eyesight is terrible and so on my phone i struggle but the kindle really is a great size that i can use it even without my glassesi have amazon prime and have enjoyed the fast smooth connection and playback on the kindle fire hd a lot i feel as though i have finally pushed myself into the current century and am not devoid of decent technolofy right nowthe only thing i can think of that i might like to see added to the kindle is the ability to insert an sd card for extra storage and thats it the rest is perfection i can read again and i am not feeling very currenti was provided with a kindle fire hd in exchange for my honest opinion thank you,positive
376,i was really surprised at how great this tablet was considering the great pricei was a little nervous about the includes special offers but the offers are at the bottom in small print so they arent offensive i had a nook which is bigger but i prefer this inbetween size bigger than a smart phone but smaller than the usual tablet screen quality was great color was spectacular i went on todays deals and got a cover for it dirt cheapi wasnt expecting much but i have to say i am impressed,neutral
377,too small of a screen for my aging eyesreturned and got thehdas someone pointed out this is a problem with the user not the producti have had every single generation of fire that has been out and love them alli am sure that if i could see this one i would love it as wellhence the title of this reviewlol,positive
378,i will say that i really like that you can change the reading screen to a nice calm green tone that is much easier on the eyes even than the sepia option of thewhich i lovedis also super lightweight and small which is a plusi do a lot of reading on my kindlei will continue to purchase reading material and gamesi previously had a fire hdwhich i lostwhen reordering a replacement i should have stayed with thesimply because of the sizethat one inch makes a huge differencei like the heft my old oneof course i had it for two years and had an awesome leather holder for it so it was truly like reading your favorite bookif purchasing this version purchase the case that comes with iti wish i hadi will do that as soon as i am done writing this reviewi think the case will make a huge differencegood luckenjoy and read on,positive
379,it is different from my first fire tablet i am still learning how to get where i wantto gobut i can fit it into my purse read anywhere and it is lighter and just as easy to read oni really like the price and have recommended it to my friends and family,positive
380,i was really looking forward to an affordable upgrade to my nd gen fire which i have had and loved for four yearsi was terribly disapointed that this fire which arrived promptly went into aminute update imediatelly then would restart randomly everyminutes and would drop the wifi connection everyminuteswhile thedisplay was nice it was an unuseable productunfortunately i cannot give it fewer thanstar,positive
381,this product is difficult to use as a tablet but a disaster as a readerits much harder to order books and getting the nyt was very difficult as ellthe print on the masthead was so small i couldnt read the date and if there is theslightest glare the text becomes unreadable and it cant be used without ambient lightvery disappointing,negative
382,i got this as a gift a few days ago and i was excited because ive wanted to try out a kindle fire for a while well in some ways i love it and in some ways i didnt im a bit of a tech geek so this tablet was a little dissapointing in the hardware area what did i like i actually love the interface and i love that all my amazon stuff was automatically accessible upon set up i like the blue light night time reading filter and i like the way the email app is set up i liked the size of the screen which surprised me since i never thought id like a smaller screen too and as other reviewers have pointed out the screen quality is awesome now to the stuff that made me return it in spite of all that good stuff this tablet felt like it was borderline obsolete its got a kind of chunky design and is very heavy for its size it weighs more than otherandinch tablets ive used this unfortunately makes it slightly akward to hold for someone like me who has smaller wrists the other deciding factors for me were the ram and the lack of a memory card slot gb isnt much and while i understand that amazon provides cloud storage its still annoying to have to go through and delete things off the device and redownload something if your space is full and only gb of ram makes the fire feel more like a lowend tablet when in some ways it feels more like a midrange tablet its not as fast as my other tablet with gb of ram and its noticeable now people who dont care about these things or people who are in the market for their first tablet will probably love the kindle fire series of tablets and id recommend the hdof all of them just for the better screen resolution but people who are more tech savvy probably wouldnt be happy with this when there are other tablets similar in size and only slightly more expensive with better specsbottom line for me i love what the fire hdhas the potential to be for now im sticking with my samsung,neutral
383,i have been pleased with my fire its a quick little tablet and i enjoy reading on it too i watched a movie the second day that i had it and thought it did a very good job the price is right too im enjoying it so much,positive
384,amazon tried to make something special and fell on their face the interface is difficult at best to navigate if all you want to do is read books and use the amazon store it might be fine using apps weve trusted on our android devices just isnt an option in many cases because they arent compatible with the fire its not customaziable like an android forget using a different launcher organizing your apps or easily accessing anything thats not a game or book office apps are limited toorthat arent very good have a google play account with movies not an option here as for the fire specific features the setup of the kindle family shared library was painful and didnt result in being able to share across multiple nonfire devices the free time feature for kids is cute but terribly executed and difficult to manage in the real world tyring to use a cloud app is limited to boxcom and onedrive the amazon cloud drive is practically nonusable its slow its klunky its being returned i just think they tried too hard to make something different and proprietary but in this case different isnt good im buying a tablet instead and replacing this gift with something my older child can actually enjoy and i can use common play store apps to manage the kindle is not for me,neutral
385,overall i like the kindle hdits light its easy to use and i generally dont have any issues with it today however has shown me a flaw in the design that makes no sense the option to manually set the time on the kindle is nonexistent it relies on a wifi or data connection to set the time however ive discovered on wifi connections with certain types of security you cant log on unless the date and time are correct the inability to manually set the date and time keeps you in a loop until youre able to get to a different connection never had this issue on my other kindle fires and i dont understand why amazon would limit the user in such a way kind of a letdown,neutral
386,i got the citron yellowwith gb and offers its a bit heavy for size i dont mind as i have two first gen kindle fires that are hefty i like the crisp screen much nicer resolution than my other readers i love that i can highlight in various colors the kindle fires i have only have yellow the response is faster than the previous fire readers a little too responsive as highlighting is a little trickier getting it to take without the screen jiggling at a touch and any tilt to the side tilts the screen very quick response but that might be annoying for some who like to lied down to readi used the browser and it took me toweb pages just fine no problemi got a reasonably priced moko case for it in bright blue which looks great with the yellow edging fits greatso far very happy with the look responsecamera sucks the camera is serviceable but dont expect iphone or samsung quality shots its still nice to have that app functioni only regret not upgrading to more memory otherwise love this and i already am using the new bookerly font that is amazonspecifickindles rock,positive
387,i bought this kindle for my wifes th birthday high definition color quality at a great priceshe still uses her paperwhite but the color tablet is for books with colored pictures music movies magazinesgames,positive
388,its pretty small and trying to get the screen to open is one big painsometimes it works sometimes it doesnt wish i would of spent the money and went for kindle hdkindle isis a much better deal as well,positive

393,dont get this tablet unless you only use the amazon apps for reading video etc prime video audible if you want to use it for productivity youre buying the wrong tablet microsoft samsung and apple all offer excellent choices not to mention other rd party android tablets that are far more functional than this the modified android os removes the google integration which i find to be one of androids best features for those who use google and replaces it with a slow chunky version if you want a tablet for only shopping on amazoncom and using amazon products sure but if you want something with any functionality outside of that skip itas a side note dont get this for an ereader thats where amazon really shines with its kindle line,neutral
394,love my tablet havent owned it long used it a long trip and it was a life saverhours and i stayed busy with my downloaded movies books etc and did not need to be online which is good as there was no service as an amazon prime member there are several free movies books music games etc to download i purchased a good back up battery that is no larger than my tablet to plug it in when there was no electricity i can check my email surf the web play games watch movies listen to music skype upload pictures the ease of storing data in cloud is wonderful as i can just go to cloud when i am ready to transfer the uploads i want to my fire tablet like theinch screen very clear the typing keyboard is easy and i can even type documents basically this tablet can be used for anything so long as the app is downloaded great warranty inexpensive no problems easy to use recommend ear buds for audio also purchased a case for protection which i really like compact size makes it easy to carry i would purchase this again,positive

398,i bought the first gen fire when it came out a couple years back and was never really impressed with itso when my son was ready for his first tablet device i thought for sue the th generation fire would be leapsandbounds above the firstoh how i was wrongmy biggest complaint wifi connectivity is atrocious meaning it routinely drops my ghz i guess i was wrong to think i could use the ghz as an optionive tried everythingits the only device i have in the house that just cant seem to stay on the wireless network often times it just doesnt even see my network it literally just goes awayi wish had spent the extra cash on a different brand oh how i loath apple but am thinking i should have went with an ipad,neutral

402,i purchasedof these tablets a year ago i didnt know what i was going to get and had carefully considered which tablets to buy i am more than pleased with my purchase the only bad thing i have to say about this product is the constant advertisements on the screen but you can pay additional fee to opt out if you wantamazon also has a truley hassle free replacement policy and i have recommended this device to friends and family because of this positive experience one out of thetablets would not power on a few months agoi called amazon and had a replacement withindays at no charge and no hassle,neutral

404,so i took the plunge i bought a kindle firei boughtkindle fire ’s and hot damn do i love these things i bought two for my kids the edition with the foam case and the year of freetime included and bought the gb in cobalt for myself is it an ipad not by a long shot but to me it’s better i’ve had a first gen and currently have a second gen ipad and i like it it’s fast big and has that certain apple look that let’s everyone know at the local starbucks’ that you’re either a hipster or you want to be one the firehas none of that it’s small and made of plastic but therein lies the beauty of theit’s ultra portable and just begs you to take it with you top of the ferris wheel at the local fair check in the middle of the st johns river in a canoe yep at work when you should be doing more important things like actual work bingo this little bit of plastic and glass has rekindled that’s right a pun deal with it my love affair with the tablet for me it’s not too big and fits just right in the pocket of my favorite pair of levi’s it may not be a powerhouse but it’s exactly what i want from a device i also love the cost i mean fori don’t think i’ll be devastated if anything happens to it,positive
405,the kindle fire hdhd is the perfect size for me excellent picture quality very fast fits easily in my purse since i gave my daughter my kindle paperwhite she reads much than i this kindlehd is a good size for my reading i purchased mine as refurbished through amazon and there are a couple reasons forstars instead offirst unlike other ereaders ive used the kindle app only hasoptions to select the size of letters tiny or huge no in between second and most important my volume buttons do not work at all using the settings for the system i can adjust the volume but of course its not the same volume for different apps i can hardly hear on youtube even with the settings volume turned all the way up its very much of a problem to have to go into settings to adjust the volume its less frustrating to avoid anything that requires sound i think the refurbishing department neglected to check my system before sending it on to me,neutral
406,excellent value for the money with crisp display and good processing speed that quickly loads internet pagesalthough a small tablet it is great for travel whether commuting or on business tripsonly complaint is the limited selections of apps available in the amazon storeit is consistently disappointing to see great apps available for apple and android products but not for amazon,neutral
407,i was initially hesitant to invest in a refurbished kindle especially after reading how difficult it is to connect to a homepersonal wifi networkhowever we were going on a long road trip with my young daughter so even if i had to go to mcdonalds to log on to a public network to get a few games tv shows or books it would be worth the entertainment value versus hearing are we there yet for six hourswell i am happy to say that it paid offwe have remedied the homepersonal wifi connection problem the wps button on the router needs to be pressed before attempting to log inwe have now owned this kindle for just over one month and it continues to be a source of entertainment for my daughter and husbandno problems with connectivitywe have only been disappointed by one or two game apps that seem to require a large amount of ramthis kindle does well with boom beach and bad piggies no problems streaming videos if you give them a little time to buffer,negative
408,really nice sometimes the ads annoy me so if i had to do it again id opt out but whatever it is what it is also its kinda small but i mean it isso its not like i didnt know its the perfect size for reading i just wish it was a bit bigger for netflix and games but i also have a tv and a computer so cant really complain about that either i havent had any problems with it whatsoever buy a screen protector and a case tho cause you never know whats gonna happen its also a bit heavier from my friends kindles they have theinch and its thinner weirdly enough but i prefer the thicker heavier one so im happy with it,neutral
409,very good budget tablet its small but i liked the smaller size it has all of the amazon services i believe excellent ereader my only complaint is the battery life it burns through the battery so fast im not sure if this is a norm with tablets,positive
410,its a pretty good tablet i dont know that much about tablets i love laptops i have issues with touch screen i dont recognize the icons having no instructions is frustrating to me its better than the android i have,positive
411,so far its great the size works well for booksthe battery seems to go for a few days with heavy reading and light video watchingthe amazon underground is pretty great for someone that doesnt spend much on appsvery happy with purchase,positive
412,i wish i could sign in to youtubebeware you cant get google play or google apps on this model with any amount of sideloading appsamazon also hates competitors and makes you sideload scribda lot of developers refuse to port their games to the amazon store also so your selection is limitedyou can not put yourbooks from other sources into books they go into documentsthats really annoying as i buy directly from small presses a lotsome good stuffnice sizesturdynice screen bright clear eats the battery atas expectedgood sound great for netflix or audiobooksconclusion if you can afford it get a real android tabletunless youre set oninch tablets then this is really the only option out there worth looking at,positive
413,do not buyunless you dont mind rebuying every year and a half i purchased this item in feband while it was a bit slow it suited my needs as the price was unbeatablenow i know whylast week i went to connect it to my speaker and play music via spotify basically the only thing i used it for but i couldnt because it had restarted and was stuck on the golden fire startup screen i tried restarting it several times i let it die and then recharged it i tried the remote factory reset which is useless unless connected to wifi then i went online and sadly i read all the reviews from people who had similar problems and received the same response from amazonsorry after a year theres nothing we can do but sell you another one at a slight discounti declinedso if youre looking for something thats not going to work as soon as the warranty is up then this is for you,negative
414,im disappointed in this tablet mainly because it does not have the capability for expansionyes the description of this one particular tablet does not indicate that but every other tablet including the cheaperdoesafter looking at several different ones and settling on this i thought it would have at least the same capabilities as the cheaper modelmy mistakeim also not sure how im going to like the fire osi bought afor my mother and she seems happy with it but ive realized already that this device is very limited in apps etcamazon wants to have a closed system so you cannot easily work with anything outside of the amazon ecosystem chromecast etc combined with the very low storage this is going to have limited use for meany plans for carrying videos on trips are out the windowmy suggestion depending on your needs is either get the larger tablet with storage expansion or if you can spring for an android tablet try to pick up one of those,negative
415,i waitedyears to review this item and i do not regret my purchase evenyears after the release of this product my children are slightly extremely obsessed with electronic devices this tablet was their first deviceyears later both children still adore their tablets the fire is no joke they are able to access the internet read books play games and entertain themselves with games of all sorts they have never once complained about any limitations or other things that might hold them back from being fully occupied or entertained by these tablets they love to be able to watch netflix and play whatever games or apps they have downloaded at any given time amazon settings allow for easy observation of my kids searches so i do not worry about their internet connectivity when they use their tablets phenomenal quality and workmanship i will always buy amazon tablets for my kids apple has nothing on amazon,neutral
416,i like the size of thisfire tablet not too bignot too small good sound and the quality of the display is greatit has a real heavy feel to it which to me is a sign of good quality because it means it is not made of cheap material and is made welli basically bought this to read my ebooks with but also play some of the games i like to play on my phonei have been able to download most of my favorite apps but there is a couple of apps i can not get on the fire which almost made me give itstars but that actually was my error in not reading up and making sure all my favorite apps was available sostars it isthis is my first fire tablet well actually this is my first tablet and i believe i did make a good choice in getting this oneit is also the perfect size for me to be able to stick it in my purse and take it with me when i leave the house,positive

418,this tablet has an awful battery life glitches and is awful today my battery was at about less thanat aroundits aroundright now and my tablet is atthat is with my brightness at a bit more than half basic math says that my battery life istohrs long now amazon coins arent working i am not getting more when i make in app purchases like i should my charger is acting up to and just by swinging my tablet makes the cord fall out the bar will flash through charging and not ive done everything the instructional video showed me and i have tried three outlets just to run the tablet takes roughlygigs the emojis are odd <U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E38><U+393C><U+3E35> see and the new update killed it the carousel a feature i favored is now gone what the heck the auto rotation lock is not working doesnt lock at all and it gave me an automatic trial for prime i did not know about and i think it charged me because it did not tell me about prime so i did not know i had it so i could not turn it off also an audio book i did not download eats up overmegabytes and i cannot delete it or archive it i totally will not ever recommend this crap to you,neutral
419,i have the itouch iphone ipad so couldnt resist this small one from amazonit does more than i thought it would small enough to fit in my purse although it isnt any lighter i have not had itlong enough to say anything about how long it will work but so far its well worth the money i paid for iteven though i have all three sitting beside me i find that i go for the smaller one,positive
420,this fire hdis amazing this isnt the first kindle fire i have owned but the last one i bought a few years ago so this was was something new and different for me first off i like that you can pick different colors so i had to pick pink as its my favorite i bought a few ebooks at the same time as my purchase and i was pleasantly surprised when i first turned on my kindle that they were there and ready to read this kindle is very easy to maneuver through i am loving the size of it its not overly big and can be held in one hand i get plenty of use out of one battery charge i am unsure how many hours but i did use it a few days before needing a charge i am highly impressed with this and will be looking to get one for each of my kids,neutral
421,this kindle isntmonths old yet and im already having battery issuesmy previous kindle was an hdxand the screen quit working on that before it was a year old my first kindle had charging issues a fourth kindle kids version i bought for my granddaughter is also not chargingi love my kindles but find their overall quality subpar my kindles are strictly for my use other than the kids version i bought for my granddaughter so they do not suffer abuse and are kept in protective coversas a reference i also ownipad minis allare still working and have never required service i simply like keeping current technology so i keep replacing my ipads with the latest and greatest the grandchildren play with them without issues they are also in protective coversi sincerely hope amazon gets the quality of their tablets up to par if they are going with cheaper materials in order to keep costs down then they might be better off using better quality and upping the pricei see they now have installment plans for them,positive
422,first off i thought this fire hd kindle was going to be like a tablet well i was so wrong its like a tablet but better your able to do everything a tablet would do but then some i love that its well made and isnt cheap like these tablets ive boughttablets in the pastyears for my kids non of them seem to hold up and not only that they all seem to have software issues i can honestly say this kindle is well made and made to last longer thanmonths i love that you can get a extend protection plan i also love that i can read any book i want on it my kids love that they can play games and watch movies most of all i love that the battery last it will out last allof my kids tablets by hours its a nice size and its super nice that its portable i got it during a promo at no charge for my honest review i honestly love it and will never buy another tablet again,positive
423,i have had this tablet for aboutdays now and i am very disappointed and often annoyed by it for the most part it works fine but there are some things that glitch consistently some things i dont seem to have user control over and some interface things that are just frustratingfor example every time i turn the screen on there is an ad from amazon every time ive poked around in the settings and cant seem to find the option to turn this off or to set a picture of my choice insteadevery time i hit the circle to go to my home screen its different i guess there are multiple displays for the home screen and it randomly cycles through these i would prefer to have a consistent home screen with my apps organized by me based on my preferencesthere is a preinstalled washing post app which while kind of nice continues to pop up on my home screen every day even though i remove it from my home every dayturning the wifi on and off is done in a separate wifi window rather than through a simple toggle on the initial pull down screenthe silk internet browser has many problems the first is the lack of a back and forward arrow you have to hit on an icon to access these rather than having them present on your search bar like in most internet browsers it glitches every single time i select the app it always opens a tab i went once on the first day i had the tablet i close it then go to the tab i wanted and it refreshes the tab i have selected this is fine for some sites like facebook but really annoying for others like if youre reading an article online and it keeps resetting to the top of the page also the browser has frozen on me a few times again doesnt seem like a big thing but the tablet is brand newthe amazon prime video app has glitched on me on the first day it has played the videos audio but only displayed a white screen restarting the tablet fixed it sometimes it doesnt keep my viewing progress uptodate for example when watching episodes of a tv show if you close the show out and come back into the show it loads up an episode from the previous seasonthe kindle reader almost always goes back to my bookshelf when i reselect the kindle window rather than resuming in the book i was currently reading the display options for the kindle are more limited than they were on my nexus for instance im not able to have the text presented in two columns like the pages of a book it can only be one column i suspect this is because of the size of the tablet screen and an assumption that two columns would not be pleasing on this small screenthe charger unit is also inconvenient it has the option of plugging into a computer via usb to charge or you can charge it through an electrical outlet unfortunately the configuration of the charger unit is bulky and unwieldy if you have it plugged into the top of an outlet it completely blocks the lower plug from useall of this said there are some things i like about the tablet its thicker than the nexus which gives you something more substantial to grip onto while reading its got good brightness control getting decently bright and dim for comfortable day or night reading its got good volume control it seems to take good pictures and videos the video camera on the nexus was almost always blurry it automatically saves these to a free cloud storage its got good processing speed it has good video resolution it is hd afterall it was a good price for what youre gettingtaking everything together the next time i need to buy a new tablet it sadly wont be a fire,neutral
424,i love my kfhd i would love to see a newversion with micro sd slot would be so great i havegb andgb in my house everyone loves how small they are and how great the games and movies look on them it really is the perfect size,positive
425,if this were for me it would already be returned the touch screen is pretty terrible we average abouttaps to get it to do things the user interface is not very intuitive it works unlike any tablet ive ever used making it even more frustrating whats worse most of the apps weve put on it fail freeze or shut down thats the ones that we can open there have beenorthat we cant even open the whole thing is really frustratingi often wonder why we didnt get something betterbut then its not for me its for myyear old she loves that it is pink she loves the games that work even with the bugs and she loves that she can watch videos the pathetic touch screen doesnt seem to bother her too much we decided not to send it back because she really is happy with it but i dread every time she says mooooommmmyyyy i neeeeeed youuuuuu because i really do hate trying to get it to do what it is supposed to,negative
426,i wasnt sure if i would like the smalleri thought that it might be too small but it is the perfect the size although still a little on the heavy side i think its great that amazon offers various color options and not just black however the cobalt is really dark its almost black closer to navy blue it was not quite as bright as i thought it would be compared to the picture shown the display screen is clear with bright colors it was very easy to set up and sync all my social media and email accounts i like that a wall charger adapter is included and not just a usb cable like so many other electronic devices these days the sound is not very loud but listening with headphones is fine it has a front and rear facing camera but the picture quality is just ok this is a nice tablet for an affordable pricei received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,positive
427,great size and pictures videos etc are unbelievable love it love it love it just wish theyd reward loyal constant customer as they do st time customers with the prime membership or any reward,positive
428,no google play store its not compatible with many google or apple apps and this severely limits the functions it can do without eating up your data for instance you cant play pokemon go plants vs zombies candy crush etc its basically just a giant smarphone which doesnt link to apple or google appsthe display is crisp and it works smooth as silk it charges quickly and looks sleek and beautifulwould i buy it again heck no im saving up for a google tablet since they dont limit what i can do on my own darn deviceif you like kindle only for reading the downloadable kindle books youll like this the backlight means you can read in the dark the touchscreen is smooth for turning pages and it lets you browse the amazon store and buy more books really easily,neutral
429,bought one to replace a first generation kindle fire that was starting to give me troubleplanned on backing up all my books and documents to my pc and then uploading to the new kindle fire hdguess what the kindle fire hd is not plug and playinstructions on the kindle for enabling interface with the pc sends you to a site that wants you to load an obsolete version of windows media player for the xp operating systemi run windowscalled tech support they had me download and install two other pieces of software which also didnt workafter wasting my time with that tech support was going to put me on hold and transfer me to a higher level tech supportat that point i told them to forget it i was returning the device,negative
430,the battery life is not great if i leave it untouched fully charged for a couple days it will be dead when i go to use it again its also pretty slow and the memory fills up fast i only paidbucks for it after using points so i cant really complain that much but i wouldnt recommend this device to someone who needs a wellworking tablet,neutral
431,i bought this tablet to travel with due to its sizei made the best choice for travel since its very potable size i can quickly put in my purse functionality it stands up to its larger competitors and is very responsive it quickly connects to avail wifi goes to any website i want with no lag time same with email accounts an facebookpicture quality is better than my iphone san a plus with frt and back camerahave watched a few movies an the hd makes it feel like a larger screen i really like that i can download tv show an movies to watch when i cant connect to wifithus is really a good feature while travelingi gave itstars only because i dont have access to google apps an cant get my banks app along with other android apps i could use other than this thus tablet is one of the best on the market after trying out other brands out therei highly recommend this tablet to anyone who wants high quality ithats very portable,neutral
432,i bought this back init worked really well for my autistic son i didnt want to get one to expensive because he is rough with his stuff and this was the perfect pricei would have gave itstarsbut they have updated it and now its not working right it freezesalot sometimes you cant get out of his gamesthe screen will go black sometimes aswell he gets so frustrated with it the only thing i can do to fix it is hold the button down until it goes off when it comes back on its only a matter of time before it does that agian ive tried to restore it to factory condition many timesbut it continues to do this it had never done this untilthe update all my children have fires and my favorite one thathad no problem with anything and was super easy for my young toddlers to use was the kindle fire hdxwhichthey no longer saleif you do plan to getthis tablet for a child id suggestspending a little bit more and getting a better one,neutral
433,got this kindle primarily for school i hope to use this to read all of my textbooks and other school items so far i like it this is my first nonapple tech device that i have owned so its im still getting use to the os one thing i would recommend for theinch display is a stylus having used ipads in the past i never felt the need to use a stylus but with this tablet i felt that a stylus made using this easier especially since i am going to be highlighting pages and taking notes on this for me using my fingers felt clumsy i hope to update this review in the future after having more time with it,positive
434,i like it a lotit has good sharp graphics sound and is very portable in size the main reason i bought itit is not as fast as myhdx fire tablet which i adore it seems heavier and the battery does not last as longhowever it is a good tablet a great price and small enough to tuck into a crossbody purse for travelling,positive
435,this was a gift for my daughter who is a minorthe parental controls are very helpful although difficult for me to understand but the amazon customer support over the phone is amazing the service representative was very helpful in helping me to understand how to use and set up the device parental controls and how the device is linked to my amazon accountthey were even able to set settings on the device remotely over the phonemy daughter loves the device and uses it daily for entertainmentmostly books and gameshowever im not really sure what the difference is between this productwhich is marketed for reading books as i understand itother than it being linked to my the parents amazon account which has its pros and consall in all it has been reliable and is functioning properlythe wifi works great as well,positive
436,screen is good speed is good all around very good value for the price ofadvertisements can be a little annoying when i am trying to swipe right to go back to the tablet screen its kind of like having a pocket tablet do wish for the future models to have an expandable memory like a micro sd card good enough speakers for the size battery life was a little lacking it should last for much longer,neutral
437,i inherited this item from my elderly fatherinlaw who could not operate it i understand his frustration the silk browser is terrible and amazon seems to want none of their customers to be able to switch over to a browser that works just looking out forthanks guysi would discourage anyone from wasting their money on this piece of junk,negative
438,for the price it cant be beat i mostly just use it as a supplement to my iphone so the lack of certain apps is mostly just annoying not a dealbreaker i mostly just use it for watching videos on amazon video netflix and xfinity tv go but i also love it for whispersyncd audiobooksebooks oh and games occasionally as well as music on either amazon music or spotify,neutral
439,honestly my daughter likes the kindle fine but when it arrived and came out of the box it was far too small for me seemed more like a phone than a tablet if the kindle were mine i would have returned it immediately for being too small of course i was forced to buy this one because the larger one no longer comes with g internal shame on amazon for that,positive
440,we have an older version and it just seems to run more smoothly than the newest modelits a bit of a challenge to navigate and seems to run slower than our previous model especially when loading appsalso a frustration i did not realize that you cannot download prime tv videos etc onto the kidfreetimeso frustratingi got this for my kids to be able to watch downloaded prime content but can only access them if i log in under my account which then defeats the purpose of parental controlsit would have been nice to know that prior to purchasing these still they are a decent tablet for the pricei looked at a lot of other kid tablets and this seems to have still been the best choice,positive
441,great for my daughteri purchased this fire tablet for my daughter she really wanted a tablet that she can read her ebooks on and where she can play games and entertain herselfi originally was going to get the fire tablet for kids but this had the best price i purchased on amazon day and also this had the best memorythe one thing i did was also purchase the screen cover protector and the fire case in case my daughter accidentally dropped it and broke itso far the fire has worked great and its a life saver on days where she wakes up super early and has nothing to doshe loves her tablet and i love it too because i can read my ebooks on there tooi dont have any issues with this tablet and i love that i got it on amazon prime day saved myself,positive
442,i bought this for myyear old for christmas so she hasnt seen it yet but im excited to see how she reacts she has been wanting something like this for awhile and i have been reluctant to get her a tablet at her young age after reading the reviews i finally decided to get it it has so many great features and is a perfect tablet for her to read books onso i will just be monitoring her usage the display is stunning i have an ipad and i payed quite a bit for it to look soo good so i really wasnt expecting such a great product for this price to be honest it is easy to navigate and simple enought for my daughter to use worth the money,positive
443,the good newssound is excellentscreen resolution is excellentwas able to download a movie from amazon and watch it on a plane this was my primary goal the battery lasted fine for thehours this tookthe bad newstouch screen is unresponsive compared to every phone i have used this is quite annoyingbattery drains quickly if the device just sits unused i am not sure what is going on hereit is not easy to find a lot of good free prime movies most movies have a fee for downloading and a rental timeout this surprised mebottom line i will keep using my samsung phone for everything except watching movies when flyingdon,positive
444,i dont find tablets to be that useful in general to me they are primarily mediaaccess devices not serious productivity tools for a functional cloudbased general purpose device i would choose a chromebook however within the limits of its capabilities this tablet has good functionality for the price it is a nice and unusual size its about the biggest size that will fit comfortably in one of my hands i bought it for the specific purpose of controlling various amazon devices in an iot demo i put together at work so that was a big factor in selecting this tablet amazon tablets are very amazoncentric as an amazon access device it is excellent as a generalpurpose tablet it is not as flexible as a typical android tablet which tend to be googlecentric but easier to modify than an amazon tablet which is almost as lockeddown as an ipad,positive
445,i boughtof these they work pretty well n i got them on sale iuse it when my ipad is dead which is ofteni like the sleek design n that its not heavy like my ipad also like that it has a h d memory card to store picsi bought the kids version forn it didnt even come w a memory card slot disappointing cause i only paidfor this tableti like that u hear a beep when u geta messageonly thing is im having trouble downloading utube triedfactoryreset i guess i didnt do it rightwish it would have come w n instruction manuel but thats no big deali have friends from church who couldnt say enough about this tablet we can use it as a biblen hume book for our church if it breaks no big deal at that price but no problems yet n idont even have it in a casei agree w my friends this is a great tablet n wont hurt your hands like the heavy pricey ipad,neutral
446,as someone who is picky about tech but also budget conscious i have to say this is definitely worth more than the pricescreen quality is better than mostinch tablets the perfect size for reading descent speed and morethe only complaints i have is it is heavy for its size and it doesnt dim down as much as id like it to as i like to read in the dark till i fall asleep sometimesi know bad for the eyesi have never written a review before but i thought this deserved onebtw i would definitely recommend thegb if you want any storage at all on the devicewhen all said and done i only hadgb left to use so for angb that would have only left aboutgb or so leftit really is a preference on whether or not you like to use the amazon cloud a lot or not,neutral
447,this tablet is greatthe screen is super clear compared to the larger kindle tabletsits easy to hold in one handthe interface takes some getting used to if youve never used a kindle tablet before but it becomes intuitive after a whilethe available apps run fast and ive experienced no lag so farif i have any complaints its that the standby battery life could be better and it immediately didorsystem updatesim not sure why it didnt just upgrade once or since it was brand new why it was so far behind in the updatesneither would not prevent me from recommending the tablet,positive
448,im anyear old do not only a good deal of reading but also writing articles on islam and middle east topics i ordered this special kindle on the advice of one of my sons after receiving the fire hd and having transferred the books already on my old kindle i have not succeeded to get the new kindle to help me from text to speech i asked for the help of two of your associates they were kind and efficient in giving me the proper instructions but still i cannot get the fire hd to do what i had hoped it would do im sad for spending the money and not able to get what i neededplease do not publish but do try and help me thanks,positive
449,i would have initially given itstarsuntil recentlyi think its great quality with more features than i can usebuti havent been able to connect to my home wifi in more than a week so its purty much useless to me now its been working just fine since decemberwhen i bought it i have gone though every diagnostic support group and help site that i could find plus a few that i just couldnt understand but no luck the thing is i know the wifi is working correctly since roku and my laptop work just finein the same room so unless youre a tekkie bewareupdate i have changed my rating tostars after all almost by accident i ran across an article that explained the wps button my my wifi router pressing that made the tablet work it stopped a few times but is now finally holding,positive
450,i love my kindle fire hd i am used to using my iphone and havent used a tablet i wasnt sure if i would be able to get used to the kindle but i was impressed with how easy to use and user friendly the kindle is i use my kindle to read ebooks check my social networks and to watch netflix i was very impressed with how quickly and lagfree viewing netflix movies is on the kindleatthis little device is an absolute steali received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review opinion is entirely my own,neutral
451,i have had many kindles both email reader and fires right now i have this and the fire in prosi love that they offer more than black the screen resolution is notably sharper than theit is a nice handy size its durable great as an ereader and watching mediaconssurprisingly heavy for its small size in my opinionslow internet my biggest complaint which amazon has not been able to fix is it keeps dropping wifi not when im using it but if i have been off of it for some hours then turn it off the wifi is not working my network is shown as offlinethe only way to fix it is by doing a soft reset holding the power until it goes off then turning it on againthis is especially noticeable if i move it out of the house and come back as i use whisper sync between this and my other kindle it means i have to keep rebooting the thing looking online this does not seem a fluke it seems others have experienced the same problem finally i bought it when it wasits not worth that but at the price now offered it is worth it,positive
452,i love this little kindle fire it is my third fire i use it mainly for reading and buying books it is fast and lightweight fits right in the palm of my hand even with the case like the blue shade feature i wish i would have paid attention and realized it was themodel i would have paid extra for a newer model my last fire i bought inand this little fire is the replacement for it the price and the size is what did it for me if this last for two years forit will be more then worth it i could not believe all the improvements since these first came out im even thinking about getting a bigger size for web surfing wait and see,positive
453,the fire hd i received for christmas has not met any of my expectationsi am sorry my husband wasted our money on it and am still considering resetting it to factory settings and returning iti was successful in purchasing and downloading one booknone of the apps i have downloaded have been completed to the point that i could open or use them so i have deleted them all,neutral
454,at first i wasnt sure about the size i have other kindle readers and another kindle fire the more i used it the more i liked it the weight is great and the size also to just throw in my purse and take it with me after using this one i wen back to my bigger kindle fire but that lasted one night only i find this one to be much easier to read with at night in bedas for performance and screen quality this suits me just fine its fast and perfectly clear colors are vibrantmy bigger kindle fire is sitting in the drawer,positive
455,fire osreviewthis review is aimed specifically at the major software update we just received not at the particular kindle fire modeli myself use an hdxwhich i love in terms of its hardware and until the system overhaul that osbrought had loved for its software as wellsince this review will be rather lengthy you can just read the headings that seam pertinent to youi will be reviewing this in terms of comparison and contrast with how it has improved or devolved since fire os topicslock screenpulldown menumain user interface uibuiltin appsbugs lock screenpros the lock screen has added a really nice feature allowing us to directly access the quick pulldown menu with wifi airplane mode etci will talk about the development of the pulldown menu in the next part of this reviewanother nice feature is the ability to directly access the camera app from the lock screen with a swipe from the bottom right cornercons as is the case with almost all the changes for osthe cons far outweigh the prosfirst the biggest problem with the lock screen is the loss of the direct ability to pause skip or go backseconds when listening to an audiobook or to music as we had beforeeven with access to the pulldown menu on the unlock screen we are not able to control playbackwe must unlock the screen first and then access the pulldown menu to access the playback controlsridiculousthe other major nuisance of the lock screen is the fact that the unlock swipe has been changed from a righttoleft swipe in the middle of the screen which allows for onehanded operation of a large tablet to a downtoup swipe from the middle of the bottom of the screen forcing twohand operation to unlock the tabletto add insult to injury this time fro the gesture to actual unlock seems to take longer than beforefinally i find it obnoxious that amazon added a quickswipe into shopping on the lockscreen as though accessing the amazon store is as essential as accessing the camera quicklyseems to me there are many other apps that deserve such a useful piece of lock screen real estate say email pulldown menupros this is one of the aspects of osthat is done pretty well overallit provides all of the most essential features wifi airplane mode blue shade do not disturb settings autorotate toggle mayday help and firefly to catch the name of that song on the radio quicklyblue shade is an excellent feature addition which allows us to use the fire before bedtime without the sleeppreventing overuse of blue lightthe blue shade removes the blue light turning the screen a reddish color and dimming it though you can easily adjust the redyellow balance and brightness to your likingcons the biggest con has to do with the implementation of audiobook playback controlsmusic playback controls are largely unchangedif you play a song then playback controls are added into the native pulldown menuhowever for audiobooks the playback controls are added as a white notification below the native pulldown menuthis has two disadvantagesfirst the controls are ultrasmall requiring superaccurate touchessecond i have not figured out what triggers its disappearance but the playback controls seem to randomly disappear from the notification sectionthe fact that i can even remove them from the notification while the audiobook is still playing is also weirdthey should be there permanently unless i actually quit the audiobook app as they were with os nonprocon this depends on preferencei like less options but others like moreif you own a kindle fire like owning an ipad you understand that you are losing customization choices with the osnevertheless some might be annoyed that there is no customizability with the actual pulldown menu’s native items though all of the notifications and priorities can be controlled through the app settings menu main user interface uiperhaps i’m using the wrong wording but when i say the main ui i simply refer to how the whole home screen tabs animations etc have been tweaked or more accurately mangled with os prosprobably the best new feature that was added to the interface is the addition of a small box icon next to the home circle and back arrow iconswhen the box is tapped you will get a carousel view of all running appsin fact this view has revealed either a new problem with the os or perhaps a problem that remained hidden in previous versions since there was no “app reveal” buttoni am including a screenshot of the problemas you will see the system seems to run duplicates once apps are openedi am only including an example that shows two of these music and settings but the problem persists across all builtin appsan app exists for settings as well as menus accessible from settings—wifi settings email settings parental controls etcmusic artists each take up an app tab the music library requires an app tab etcthus the system appears to be wasting a lot of resources running so many separate appsthe other possibility is that this is always the case in the os with the aim of speeding up launches but the end result is still an extremely cluttered app carouselwe only need one settings tab one music tab etcanother possible pro for some is the ability to change the home screen wallpaperi prefer the simplicity of the original dark gray screen of osless distracting when searching for a colorful app that could be lost in the colorful background but i was easily able to change the wallpaper to a simple gray to suit my needsothers may like the ability to put their own pictures or scenic backgrounds to more personalize the home pageconsperhaps the most egregious of the ui problems is the removal of a main tab for photos and docssome might argue that the docs tab gets less mainstream use but photos is undeniably one of the most frequently used apps for most usersnevertheless both photos and docs have been removed from the major tabs in the banner across the main screen while keeping a tab called “shop”that is to say in order to push for impulse buying amazon has removed the instant accessibility to photos in favor of keeping an entire tab dedicated to shoppinganother major change with the os is that instead of accessing tabs within the main screen each tab has been broken into separate appsphotos and docs have been removed from the tabs and exist only as separate apps that we can open from the home screen or from the apps tabthe result is more home screen clutterwhat is crazy is that all of the apps are stuck on the home screen…they can no longer be removed for a neater home screen the only workaround i have found is that i can combine them into their own “folder” so that instead of taking upapp spaces i can cull them intoapp folder spacewhile on the topic of the home screen it is also worth noting that we can no longer save our favorite books as an applike icon to the home screenfor example i read my bible every daypreviously this could just be seen immediately on my home screen next to my silk browser appnow i must go to the inconvenient recent tab discussed laterregarding the tabs music apps shop etc these have become less usefulpreviously you were brought directly to your library for the selected tab now the screen wastes resources animating a movement to a tab which shows you your most recently accessed apps but you must additionally tap “library” in order to see all of it which is exactly the same library interface we had on osthus two taps are required to do what was previously one tapthis is a small insignificant amount of time but the digression in usability is the bigger problemwhat happens when osrequires three taps then fourwhen accessing the apps tab the results are far more problematicseeing only five apps in the tab section we almost always have to view the library but the apps library has become horriblethe apps are not viewable as iconsinstead they are in a list form with their icon name downloadcloud status and a context menufirst of all this view makes it impossible to see more thanapps at a timesecond of all you can’t tap the app name or icon to open ittapping these will bring you to the app information page in the storeridiculousthis makes no sense from a ui perspectiveinstead the only way to open it is by tapping the tiny “open” button on the right sidei’m not sure how many felt about the carousel that previously dominated the home screeni loved itinstead this has been replaced by a recent tabi have two problems with thisone it now requires two taps instead of one to access the most recently usedappstwo the apps are organized in a vertical pane instead of a carousel though i know this is more habitvisual preference than a con with the system uii think that we should either have the option to activate a carousel into the home screen or the carousel should be added as a permanent strip between the tab titles and the apps on the home screeni think this is much more efficient than forcing me to either tap recent tab the boxappreveal icon or the other associated tab ie books for my biblethis is a small ui problem and easily fixablepreviously we had sliders for turning things like on or off eg the wifihowever they did not give a visual cue that they needed to be slidthey have changed these sliders to now look like slidersexcellent rightthe “sliders” are shown as small floating dot inside of an oval that is orange when the dot is on the left to indicate on and gray when the dot is on the right for offhowever a sliding motion does not move this dotinstead of sliding we must tap themit makes no senseif a tap is required the icon should not be shown as a slider it should be shown as a tapswitch otherwise the sliding motion we used in osshould be preserved to go with the much better visual slider cue builtin appsi will only speak about the system apps i use most frequently as i cannot comment on apps that i didn’t really use in os calculator this app has a huge new problemthey got rid of the “c” and “ce” buttonsthus as you tap out “” you can see the answer “” below it on the screen like any normal smartphone calculatorno need to tap ““ to find the answerbut how do you delete the numbersno “c” buttonyou must first tap “”the “del” which had only functioned as a backspace will then change to “clr” and then a really slow animation erases the answer so that you can begin a new problemthere is in fact space on the calculator to keep both the del and clr buttons visible at the same time without squeezing shrinking or removing any other keysclock the clock changes look nice but they don’t work nicerwhen you want to set an alarm clock for example you no longer get a big number keypad where you can tap out the time you wantinstead you get a tiny little clocklike circle of numbersto choose the hour to wakefor selecting the minutes you get the same clock circle for numbersthese numbers are so small and squeezed that it is not easy to tap out the right time on first touchworse if you want a time like pm you have to do a really difficult tap onthen slowly slide your finger until theappearsby the time you lift your finger you may accidentally change it toorfrom the movement during the lift of your fingertipthis is an easily fixable problemif they insist on keeping this interface because it is more attractive then a number pad then blow up the clock…use more screen real estatethen add little dots to represent the minutes between the minute increments currently showncamera i like how the camera added the ability to tap either a photograph shutter button or a video record button from the same menu without having to switch between camera and video modethis is an excellent enduser consideration to make when addingchanging a featurealso i’m not sure if we had hdr previously if not i’m glad this was addedat the very least the camera adds a “hdr recommended” text to the screen during camera mode if you do not have it activated but it might help the shot be betteremail this has become slightly streamlined making deletion of messages easier and making the composing icon more meaningful by changing it to an alwaysvisible pen in the bottom right corneri like the email client on here and i’m glad they didn’t tweak it too muchcalendar i haven’t used the calendar very much in the past or even nowthe reason it is useless when you set a reminder but the reminder does not remind youi want my calendar reminders to go off with their alarm and turn on my screen just like the alarm clock doesinstead you won’t see the reminder until you take the time to turn on your fire and look at your notificationsit works nicely in terms of its cloud connectedness and its interface if your requirements are relatively basic but its inability to wake the device up and actually remind me of events leaves its purposes moot at this point bugsi have encountered several bugs but cannot remember all of them at the momentthe only one i can remember at the moment happens when you have a folder of apps on the home screen and open that folder then open an app inside the folderonce in the app if you tap the home circle at the bottom of the screen it will bring you back to the home screen but it will automatically enter the keyboard mode trying to make you edit the name of the folder containing the app you just accessedconclusioni am aware of how long this review of osis but i hope that bears witness to how much i love amazon and how much i had loved my fire hdxbefore this attractive but nonuserfriendly oswas automatically downloaded and added to my devicei think that many user’s who read this will notice that they share in my dislike for many of the changesi am not against change i am simply against changes that do one or more of the followingfavor visual attractiveness over user friendliness animations just to animatereplace simplicity with unnecessary complexity two taps instead of oneoverlook simple design issues small buttons on large screensi think that amazon has made all three of these mistakes with the release of osmoreover i am really unhappy with how hard amazon has pushed shopping with the added swipe on the lock screen as well as with favoring a shop tab over a much more widely used tab like photosi feel like i signed up for having the ads on the lock screen when i bought this i knew accepted and sometimes even liked theseit keeps the lock screen from being boringhowever i feel like amazon is favoring its bank account more than the end user with these choices and it does not seem very amazonlike to meas a result i givestars for the hdxtablet itself butstars for oswhich makes thestar tablet work like a star tabletamazon has always been fantastic with customer service it is why i have remained a customer since its humble beginningsand i believe in amazon’s ability to fix these issuesthey have always done a great job responding to customer feedbacki really hope that by posting this review across all devices that at least one developer sees it and responds with actions that get me back to loving my kindle firethanks for reading and hope this helps you make an informed decision about the os ecosystem you may or may not want to enter,neutral

457,my wife bought one last autumn so she could read the new yorker easily and check email and browse the web on the road more easily than on her iphonei have had a kindle touch for a while and i liked the font and layout on her fire hdfar better we found ourselves competing to share it so i got my own when it went on sale adding a gift certificate we had i never used an ipad or tablet gadget before thenfor the price sure its a bargain at even the retail rate gb admittedly is a low storage when the real capacity is gb but of course amazon expects you will be downloading fvrom their cloud much more still the functionality that integrates audible audiobooks or ones carousel of titles purchased from amazon is appealing to the eye that is why i got it i doubt i will watch movies on it and i will not be playing games for an ereader plus a web browser and email connection the keyboard and the predictive word completion are easier to use than my smartphone and the typefaces and layouts are more userfriendly the ability to alter page backgrounds more as well as fonts is a great optionadditionally the enhanced notetaking colorcoding and organization of notes for ereading is fantastic ebooks are much more enjoyable compared to a kindleone downside i found comes with the new software update soon after i fired it up it installed the family library is a nice touch allowing my wife and me to share the books and audiobooks we have bought as payment merges but the limits of the personal documents uploaded to one kindle email account mean that my signin as a different fire user prohibit me from viewing the docs i had sent originally to her amazon account for my old touch i thought the family library would allow seamless integration but apparently this is stymied by the account restrictions for documents uploaded that are not purchased from amazon and downloaded directly rather than emailed by an account user the predicament with prime being limited to one user in a family under that signin far as i can tell also continues despite the libraryanother helpful feature lacking is that on a fire the look inside or book preview feature available on a pc or a touch is missing apparently amazon is not installing that on any fire strange decision and a sad oneit does deplete its battery rapidly you can almost watch the percentage decrease but the wirelessdisabling feature is smart and i tend to turn off the wifi as much as i can to save power and to reduce the brightness contrast too this takes a while to charge but as in many devices now batteries work overtimethe colors are appealing and the feel makes it easy to hold if in my large palm some complain about the plastic rather than more gripworthy finish of the fire hdbut since i put it in a case and have a screen protector even if the gorilla glass may make these superfluous the models build itself is less importanti tried to download mp files and legal torrents but neither connected with the network not sure what is the flaw here as my wifi is fine and nonsonic text files went to this download file streaming succeeds but the transfer of sound files from the net does not work at least so far also fire seems to block the downloading of text and mobifiles to itself from nonamazon sources the only exception so far that i have found being project gutenbergs free ebooks to the web download file if not the cloud while a workaround can be found via a pc or usb this does frustrate any easy file transfersfinally the microphone does not seem to pick up my voice enough for it to work with apps i use for a vocal input a minor point but one maybe others need to know the speaker does not sound that impressive and it is mono even with inear monitors it still did not match my smartphone it sounded tinny and transistorlike to my surprise and the volume was lackingbut overall for an ebook reader browser and portable entertainment device this meets the needs and certainly the price point while designed to channel you to amazon to buy no surprise it can be used for those of us who also get our reading and listening material from other places as many if not all android apps are duplicated in amazons app store lately,neutral
458,although i wish i had purchased a larger kindle i had apreviously thehas grown on me the battery life is very good its compact and fits in my purse and the screen is sensitive to touch on a sortof downside it does get quite warm but i got a protective case and that seems to help mitigate it at least for my hands and although its small its quite dense and the case is nice so i can prop it up i would recommend this item although if you like playing games you may want to go with a larger screen,positive
459,i finally replaced my original kindle fire with this one i still love it i splurged on the gb and it seems to be doing awesome i still hate the waiting on loading but it does seem faster than the originally two days after i purchased got the email about the new kindlemodel coming out after much debate the only plus i would get with the newer model is the extrainches and almost double the battery life im sticking with this one because it does fit in most of my purses perfectly and what do i need a giant screen fortrust me splurge on the gb the storage space because it will fill up quickly,neutral

462,i use this to watch twitchtv netflix youtube and browse facebook honestly it excels at it for personal use the pricing is marvelous too i bought a standcase for it aboutbucks and i carry this everywhere i go because the battery life is simply amazing although i would not recommend this to someone that already owns a functional tablet apps do not get very frequent updates and sometimes it feels rather dated to use this tablet but i will not complain because the price makes up for everything it could lack i will however consider purchasing a newer model in the future as owning a tablet is as luxurious as it gets when smart phones are neccessities tablets just add onto the digital experience and amazon does it well,positive
463,this version i think is very slow i just opened itdays ago and i was impressed by packing design and clarity in display but even this app for amazon shopping is very slow there are lots of bugs im disappointed i was expecting it to be faster and work with its own app it freezes up and the back button doesnt work that are included in most apps i will hope to return or get a better version can someone recommend one thanksits hard to navigate and its not so sensitive to my typing,positive
464,i enjoy the fire tablet the resolution is excellent and the features are great for the price range i bought thewith the lighter case and the lesser screen resolution i misplaced myand the promotion amazon was offering spurred me to buy this one instead the only real difference i notice is it is heavier and a feels more solid than theand the resolution is noticeably sharperfunction is identical and they work fine for its primary function as a reader but flexible enough that it will work for most basic uses pandora google maps etc i use a table for only real problem is i had to buy a verizon wifi adapter to use it in the car,positive

467,hi i bought a brand new fire hdgb tablet from amazon and ive had problems with the unit from the very beginningi did not pay extra for the extended warrantyand i dont regret passing on the extended warranty because based on other reviews i would have either been sent a used reconditioned tablet that someone else has already had problems with or offered adiscount on a new fire tablet purchaseanyway the battery dies withindays even if the device is unusedive repeatedly made sure that the wifi and bluetooth are turned off and that its in airplane modeit still dies and dies and diesin the last week or so the battery life seems to have improved slightly but i have no idea whythe other big problem is that someone elses amazon searches keep appearing on my kindle fire hdand these are not search suggestions based on something ive ever typed or looked atthe search field is completely blank i put my cursor there and these searches for things that i have no interest in will appearthese searches dont appear on my kindle fire hdtableti am the only person with access to this device which is always password locked and kept in my bedroomive changed my device and account passwords repeatedly and factory reset my device repeatedly and started usingstep authentication but it keeps happeningi keep checking to see if there are any orders money transfers etc on my account that i didnt authorize but i havent seen any yetand as far as i know the multiple transactions on my credit card were made by me but these searches keep appearingi have once again deregistered my kindle fire hdfrom my account because i just dont know what else to doperhaps the coming update will fix this problemvery disappointed,neutral
468,what a great packagei love the silk browser and the apps but the reader is still the best thing about this deviceit really has great speed with the new processor and handles it all so nicelywhat a great value we are happy with our decision to get one for me and one for the spouse,positive
469,the fire hd is a good device at a decent price in fact the only real downside to the fire family is the perversion of the android os to amazon specs but thats a biggie i find it a constant distraction no where near as intuitive much harder to organize always driving you to amazon andmost importantlydoes not recognize apps from google play store and dont believe the huge amazon app library hypei use and like my fire because i have itbut wheres the reason to buy oneuntil amazon makes google play store apps availablethere is no reason to recommend any fire for anything more than an inexpensive reader,positive
470,good tablet and great buy overall i was able to buy it for onlydollarsdollars for no lock screen advertisements tax and whatnot however this price was on a black friday cyber monday sale but i would still say that the current price ofdollars is reasonable for this tablet as advice for future buyers dont open the freetime app i havent tried to open it because i dont want to risk it myself but a majority of the onestar reviews say that opening freetime will wreck your tablet see for yourself before you buy this tablet you should know that it comes with a charger cord and wall adapter it doesnt come with a case or screen protector unless you order the combo pack or the items separately anyways here are a few other pros and cons for this tabletproshd screen really enhances view experiencegreat size for reading not to big not to smalltablet is fairly customizable except for the lock screen backgroundamazon has some of its own games and apps that google dosent havea wide variety of books are available at a cheap purchase price for those who like to readlots of movies are available including newer more recent moviesbasic apps like netflix hulu and pandora etc are available on the amazon appstorethis tablet is great value for its price compared to an ipad or an ipad miniconstablet is a bit on the heavy sidemost social media apps such as instagram are not available on the amazon appstore which is the only appstore you can choose fromthe great invention of freetime doesnt work and will kill your tablet if you open it but it doesnt take out much of the tablet experienceevery so often an app wont work so you have to restart the tabletyou cant access the google play store therefore none of those apps are compatible with the tabletunlike an ipad you cant message on a kindle without first installing a messaging appi think that pretty much sums up this tabletoverall i would say that this is a good tablet for its price and if you want a good cheap tablet i would buy this tablet then again it all depends on what you want to do with the tabletthank you for reading this review have a great day autumn d,positive
471,terrible i had to return two of these cause the both stopped working on both the displays went out within two months youre really getting what you pay for here cheap junkon top of that i have had the worst customer service experience of my life with amazon regarding this item i returned both the original and the replacement kindle then received an email from amazon saying i owed themfor merchandise in their possession how screwed up is that very very let down shady business practices going on here,negative
472,i probably would have given itstars if i could upgrade to fire osive tried every which way till sunday including resetting to factory defaultdownloading to computer and transferring through usb it may be because i purchased a certified refurb im wondering if some of these refurbs were previously rooted,negative
473,i like the updated version of the os its way better than my sons fire hd with the older software it works much better for using it with kids theres just not enough storage though i cant put more thanapps and a couple of low quality min videos on it before its out of storage space the gb version would probably be perfect for us though,neutral
474,okay to start off i bought this tablet on prime day refurbished it works fine but the main reason i bought it instead of the cheaper amazon fire was the fact that this page showed that i would be able to fling or mirror my screen to my amazon fire stick which is the reason i originally bought to mirror my phone to only to find out i didnt do enough research that time it was my bad this time the page specifically said i would be able to mirror the tablet to the fire stick but got it home went straight to the tv and looked at my display settings and no mirroring options the tablet works fine otherwise the two stars is just for the fact that it doesnt do what it says it will doi would have opted for the cheaper bigger screen option had i known,positive
475,it serves its purposeim still trying out its featuresa couple of functions are not working but it does not take away from the essence of the tabletspecifically the outside charging light does not work but the inside battery charging indicator worksthe plug in ear phone does not work but the sound is okay without the plugged in ear phoneim still fiddling around with itit may be i need a new ear phoneim happy enough with the tablet as isi watchedgreat movieslistened to some musicit was terrific,neutral
476,everything i expected except operator profeciency,positive
477,i got what i wanted with this littlefire hd but small size means it has its limits several features i liked are apparently no longer available on this model at least i liked different fonts but only get a few with only a few size choices i hate that blue screen its orange and i dislike orange what happened to the gentle lovely sepia screen i guess otherwise its a great little fire and i needed a small goeverywhere one but right now im wishing i had my oldback,negative
478,very fast and awesome tablet im running fire osbattery life is ok it tends to drain alotbut besides all that i recommend get the gb because after u install all those updates lol ur going to have like no storage for u to download all those apps really fast tablet works great on minecraft pocket edition if u have a child they will use the hell out of this tablet when i first got this tablet out the box i had to update it liketimes to be to the latest software speaker is ok it gets tenny didnt get very loud doesnt mean its a dolby digital audio speaker didnt mean its super great the tablet does not run google play or any of the google apps you can still get facebook and facebook messenger so u facebook people have funbut what i dont understand is that people are missing the point hereit a kindle fire its not supposed to run google apps or google play amazon just wants to put their own ecosystem into this tablet its made to run amazon stuff if your looking for a full fledged google tablet u might want to look somewhere elsewhere and no there is no youtube app on hereyou have to use the internet browser but besides all that great tablet for a kid that just wants to play games or for a adult that just wants to read or shop on amazon or watch some netflix with he kids great tablet and yes their is a appstore with lots of famous titles such as candy crush and more please get a case this tablet will crack easy if tou drop it inches its cracks easy,neutral
479,this tablet is the perfect size to sit back and enjoy a few streamed movies or tv shows where it fails completely is blocking google play store and then not offering the same apps that you can get from google its somewhat petty to block access and then offer apps that are less than or different from what everyone else is using blue youtube app i mean its just weird and uncomfortable to have to allow amazon access to my emailswhen they allow google play on their devices i will return as it really does feel good to hold and the screen and iu is beautiful ps as a amazon fan i even liked the ads for products that appeared on the lock screen,neutral
480,after two months of use this tablet does everything i had hoped it would do except the battery life is terribleused onlyhour per day for reading kindle books with brightness turned down and wifi turned off battery has to be charged everyto four daysalso there are no warnings about low batterydevice just goes deadhave tried all of the suggestions in the forum but nothing really helpedwould like to exchange it for another unit to see if it is a bad battery but when i try they just tell me more things to try to improve battery life,neutral
481,this is a great little device small enough to fit in a pocket performance is mediocre for some of the more intense processes but it does work great for reading kindle books browsing the web watching videos and killing time battery life is pretty good its a little thickerheavier than i had hoped but i recently held it up for almosthours watching a movie and it was fine,positive
482,i bought this for my daughter and it has worked wellhowever i have an older generation kindle fire nd generation hd and i have to say i do not like how they took out the mini hdmi porti am guessing that this was done as a way toget more people to buy the firestick i really think when they make a new product they should not take away features that older models came withother than that this has worked great and unless you were planning on hooking yours up to a tv through a cable my complaint should not matter i would have bought it even if i had known about the absence of the hdmi port,positive
483,thistablet is much more convenient to carry than the larger models it easily fits in a jeans back pocket even with a protective cover on it the screen is plenty big enough to read on and the video resolution is excellent the audio buttons are not as conveniently placed as are the ones on themodel and the battery life is a good deal less hearty than the larger more expensive tablets that said the convenience of being able to put this in an inside suit coat pocket or the pocket on the seat of my jeans makes this one my new constant companion,positive
484,i like this kindle fire it is just the right size for me my previous fire was just too large i had to use both hands to hold it and it weighed a ton this kindle is much more convenient for mei use the kindle mainly for reading books generally reading a book on the kindle fire hdinch is a good experience what i really dislike about reading a book on the kindle fire is how it manages searches within the book i am reading i can put in search terms and get a list of search results easily enough however if i click on a result and it turns out not to be what i was looking for i cannot go back to the list of results and select another item say by using the back button i have to start over reentering the search criteria again what a pain i did not have this problem on previous kindles i owned i called customer service figuring search could not really be as awkward as this and i would be told that i was doing it wrong on my new kindle the amazon rep whom i spoke to however seemed quite surprised that you could not easily go back to the list of results in order to find another result and that you had to restart search she said that there was no better search procedure and that she would complain to the kindle engineers this one poorly executed feature has resulted in my ordering kindle books less often than in the past,neutral
485,i havekindles now i bought all of them as presents first i bought my grandma one she doesnt know how to use a vcr i explained the easy stuff like how to read books and play games and now she wont put it down so i got myyear old niece one she loves using it to read me bedtime stories her little brother kept stealing it so i bought him one for his th birthday best idea ever we loaded them with baby games but this is something that can grow with him instead of getting him baby ipads and unlike an ipad its cheap enough that if he breaks it i wont be as upset as i would be if he broke aipad,negative
486,when my kindle fire hd ” rd generation bought indied recently i decided to get this new ” model and i’m glad i did i use my kindle forreading ebookschecking emailstreaming video andusing a few favorite apps a major issue with my old ” fire hd was that it was too big and thick to fit in all but my largest of purses that’s why i chose the ” model when i received it i was shocked at how small it was but after a week’s worth of use i can tell you the small size is a bonus and makes the kindle even more usable and portable than my old ” i take it everywhere because it’s so easy to carry in my purse the operating system is more powerful more responsive and faster than my older model it was definitely time for an upgradethesize is perfect for reading ebooks which i do a lot of it’s easy to hold—about the size of a small trade paperback and comfortable to keep in one hand for prolonged reading this model had the highest resolution of all the kindle fires i could afford and it’s a very pleasant reading experience—much sharper text than mymodel while a few apps struggle a bit on the smaller screen some edges are cut off everything i use on the kindle runs great i have a kindle bluetooth keyboard i use when traveling or to take notes and it works well with this modelthe only downside to this kindle is that i can’t hook it up directly to my flat screen tv to stream video but i knew that going in and bought the fire stick to compensate however for individual viewing in bed or in the kitchen theinch screen is perfectwhat’s even better is that i got this kindle power plug included its case and the fire stick all for less than i paid for my original kindle plus power cord plus hdmi cord my family who have ” or larger kindles are all envious of my new set up i’m in love with my new ” and plan to take it everywhere with me from now on,positive
487,i have an original kindle fireone of the first people to buy onei wasnt able to go online with it anymore and other things it said i had to upgrade for but wouldnt let mei was skeptical about buying a new one at less than half what i originally spent but glad i didthis has amazing color i can do so much more on this than my other and as i dont have a smart phoneit is perfect for my travel needs as far as entertainment very glad i jumped and purchased this,positive
488,if youre a hooked prime and kindle user then you might love this thesize is great for holding in your hand and putting in your back pocket the ebook magazine prime video and amazon store apps are well integrated looks like my kindle voyage is going to be resting for awhile waiting for that bright sunny day at the beachyou probably know that fire runs a special version of android and the amazon app store is much more restricted than the google play store look at the other reviews for more on thati was able to find the apps i need to configure the fire to my liking i looked at all the sites for backloading the play store onto fire and decided that i dont know who to trust thats not for me i did miss hangouts which does not show up on gmail on the fire browser silk i found that there is a version of firefox called aurora available on the official mozilla site the gmail on aurora does have hangouts even thought the conversation window jumps around when the keyboard pops up you have to pinch and adjust it often but there it ishangouts on fire i use silk for everything else on the web works for me,positive
489,i had been putting off getting a kindle i think because i was set in my ways after having bought one for my son for an upcoming cruise i thought i should get one for myself as welli couldnt be happier that i did i like using the kindle much better than using my ipad because it was so heavy the picture on the kindle is so crisp i absolutely love it and the price was certainly right i wouldve bought it anyway but an extra added bonus was its color i love that it has the pink it says magenta but to me its hot pink and that its not just plain black i would definitely recommend it,positive
490,my only complaint regards customer service the product would not allow me to register it with my existing account information a glitch i suspected might be caused by the fact this is a refurbished item presumably with a former owner who registered it i chose to have amazons csr call me about overcoming this problem that phone call took way too long because once again the csr assumed i was inexperienced and had to have my hand held throughout the process rather than listening to what i was saying i also found himher difficult to understandthe operating system is a little cludgy other than that its fine for reading setting alarms taking photos and making movies,negative
491,i just got this today and i do like it i have just one minor issuewhy did amazon not include a microsd card slot that is my sole reason for reducing my review tostarsthe screen is fabulous and i love the size this will work great as my entertainment while i am working out in fact that is one of the reasons i got it since my ancient phone seems to not putting music sound out any morein my opinion this will work best with your existing prime account i will have to explore the advantages of that in my review updates coming soon,positive
492,this is an amazing tablet for the price with a few drawbacksi was originally planning on purchasing themodel for slightly cheaper however wanted the hd screen and better performance while it is a small size it works great and have not really noticed the size differencei have travelled extensively with this have used an otg adapter for watching movies on airplanes and with an appropriate case with can be held in place with the folding tray folded up to watch moviesall of the features of the tablet work great my only real complaint being the touch screen it is not as accurate as some other tablets say an ipad you have to be very specific of where you tap and this is not due to the size of the screenreading books on this is great just turn down the brightness and enjoythe screen works fairly well in bright light movies may be slightly hard to see in dark scenes however watching most tv shows reading or browsing the web has not been an issuethe other thing that amazon could have done would be to include a a charger rather than the a charger with this it charges quite slow with itlastly the last concern is the sleep battery life if you leave it locked for a few days say a week expect to have little to no battery left when you come back that is with notifications etc all turned off only wireless onoverall a great tablet especially for the price i would definately buy one again,neutral
493,i bought the tablet for a nephew in paris where i was vacationingi expected the boy to use it to play free games onlineat firstthe tablet connected easily to the house wifi but when i went to visit next timeit couldnt find the wifi while all the other electronics could show and connect to the wifi the boy ended up using it for some games not a lotfound offline,negative
494,very nice little tablet thats a bargain for seventy bucks its too bad this model lacks the sd card that the others take but extra memory can be added via the usb port that also serves to power the device but you cant use the memory sticks and charge your fire at the same time the hdalso really isnt a high definition anyway itsxamazon waited too long to add the sd card and id recommend the next model up for that crucial feature but if youre strapped for cash take the hit and use it for reading and streaming,negative
495,so if you fell in love with the previous kindle fire models stay far away from the new onesthe quality and performance although not less than whats advertised is such a far cry from the previous fire models that you will not like itthisinch model although small iscloseer to amazon quality that theinch model unfortunately it looks like this will be the last of this model as accessories and such are disappearing if you need a fire and can deal with the small size definitely get this one bfn they are gone you wont be happy with what replaces itshame n you amazon for cheapening your wonderful kindle fire,negative
496,i couldnt be happier to finally have a kindle fire ill admit i dont have any way to compare it to previous versions since this is the only one ive ever used but i am completely satisfied with my purchase it is useful for so much more than just reading and is very user friendly the kindle fire would be a great gift for anyone who doesnt already have a tablet i especially like using this as a back up method on flights as it minimizes the previous weight of my books and laptop but is just as helpful,positive
497,this little unit is a great way to get introduced to amazon fire tabletsit is user friendly and fun to read books or browse amazons website etc onthe price cant be beat eitherif you have been looking for a kindle with color this is your upgradethere are other things to use it for as well but mostly i wanted a book reader with colorthough i am sure the bigger models are nice too this one is as i said a great beginningone of my only complaints is battery lifeit eats it up in comparison with the bw kindle paperwhite uniti am still new to it though so as yet push its limits in other areas,neutral
498,love the pricing and love that its small but it is heavy heavier than my firehd or the e reader i do not use it often i thought it would be great to read or play games in bed because it was small but the heaviness nixed that,positive
499,i bought the kindle fire hdas a present for my mother she absolutely loves her kindle it arrived very fast and is very user friendly the screen is very clear and system is very fast it also holds a charge very well it is an attractive tablet and not too heavy very pleased with my purchase,positive
500,i absolutely love my kindleit runs great the screen is so crystal clear the pink color of the kindle itself looks awesome and it offers all the same apps as any big expensive fancy tablet would the compact size fits perfectly in my purse so i can always have my kindle with me for those bus rides to work with nothing else to do lol would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice tablet i received this kindle free to try in exchange for my unbiased opinion and again i love it,positive
501,i purchased another one because the first one i got had annoying pop ups so i paid extra in order for it to be ad free but its like i was sent the same kindle i was trying to get rid of what a rip off i even wasted my money on a case for it i am so unhappy with the kindle i use to love my first gen kindle i dont know what is going on with this new one,neutral
502,for the price this tablet is unbeatable my only real complaint is the fact that not all the apps your accustom to are available amazon uses their own play store and some of the apps i wanted werent available luckily i found a way to transfer the needed apps over to the tablet without issue overall the tablet has a great display the battery holds up fairly well and its smaller and lighter than other tablets fits nicely in the hand and the overall speed of the tablet is good for the price u cant find a better new tablet,positive
503,i now have my nd fire hd the camera quit performing properly and received a replacement now i have the nd and it has the same issuesi am not real sure this i want to keep this i have had the kindle fire st generation for quite a few yrs and have had no issues,positive
504,amazon fire hd i purchased the amazon fire hdjust before christmas last year during a sales push at a shopping center kiosk and the first unit was so buggy i wanted to throw it at a wall gb model left me with little space and the books and few apps i loaded quickly cut available gb in half unable to delete bloatwareand it crashed a lot as i could not compare it to my ipads i simply assumed this was the norm im not an android fan and so i saw this os as more of the same howevermonths in when the display went absolutely schizo no other words i gave up and contacted amazon i had lived with the buggymess for months as i thought i had missed aday or so coverage lazy me didnt even checkcovered for a full yeargotta give amazon credit they may be new on the scene as far as electronics are concerned but their customer service is the best ive been with them since the very beginning and their customer service is the reason i remain loyal i was prepared with photo documentation and notes regarding the screen issue however once the initial customer service rep transferred me to a very knowledgeable technical support rep he quickly noted the product issues and immediately processed a priority shipment of a replacement all i had to do was ship the faulty unit back withindays and no charges shipping of both units covered donei have now had the replacement formonths and although it has frozen a few times nothing in comparison to the buggymess i dont care for the fire os but it seems to have improved with updates i dont care to sideload so im limited to apps from the amazon store i totally loathe the silk browser i miss basic personalization i cant even remember when i couldnt change the wallpaper on a phone or tabletlittle things like that irritate until you remember its atablet thats why i bought it yes i was curious and liked the native amazon video capability as at that time amazon video on ipad has improved in the past year but xray and imdb factoids on the fire are obviously best native but primarily i purchased the fire as an inexpensive alternative to my beloved ipads for gym bag travel times when i dont need ipad size functions or software and wouldnt cry if something happened to it a tablet that was not from a noname company i could not count on amazon fireis perfect in that regard customer service was there when i needed them and it appears the line is still going sting so i can expect os updates and subscription supportpros inexpensive crisp display good in all light as you control manually but pulldown shortcuts are accessible and im sure leaving out light sensors eg ipad cut production cost wifi links well without dropping even on trains an on public wifi gorilla glass not one scratch even though i have never used a case just toss in bag and go perfect size for holding in one hand even more so than my ipad mini or phonealthough heavier and thicker than an ipad that heft makes it easier to grip excels in kindle app for reading and native amazon video app good battery lifehrs between charges amazon prime trial amazon customer supportcons keyboard has a lag of the time i begin typing and notice i have to go back as it skipped the first letters annoying carousel and amazon shopping cartwish list constantly appears even if app not used although that has improved perhaps last os update not impressed with limited cases but once again at this price i wont cringe if i scratch an otterbox would cost more than the new units hai could list numerous little wonky bugs here but the fact is i would be comparing to ipad and i do not believe amazon is trying to compete with applein closingyear later i find myself using this for very different uses than my stable of ipads but for the reasons i do throw the firein a bag instead of aipad it has served me well good job amazon,neutral
505,totally disappointedi received a device which does not support mirroring i bought a fire stick and my idea was share the screen of my new table but surprise doesnt supportdisplay mirroring how its possible while i was buying the device there wasnt any notice that this could happen totally horriblestart no messurement for this,neutral

507,i love my new kindle it is perfect for what i neededwanted i have the original kindle keyboard and either had to have my little book light clipped on it or a light on in order for me to read at night now i can read in the dark with the kindle fire and it doesnt strain my eyes to do it i can also access my one drive anywhere using my cell phone as a secured wifi hot spot i am a full time college student accessing my homework and other files on the go is very convenient i no longer need to carry my laptop or netbook to school,neutral
508,i love the amazon kindle firei own a kindle fire tablet but found a great deal on this one so i bought it tooi use them both dailytheinch size is noticeable in your hand but not so much on the screen when you are reading or watching a showif you are looking for great functioning and easy to use tablets this is a great choiceif you are looking to spend less thanthen this is the only choice you need to consideryou will not be disappointed,neutral
509,i was just looking for a basic tablet for games and movies thats exactly what this is good quality and reliable ive had no issues with mine can play games and apps without losing info when i switch phones keeps my phones memory free love watching my shows on it good resolution wish it could go a tad bit louder because i listen to it in the bathroom while i shower and at full volume i usually cant understand what is being said on a show over the sound of the water but thats my only complaint and its not even a big deal,positive
510,so far ive been quite pleased with the fire hdof course im jumping from a first generation kindle to a th generation kindle so the transformation is astounding ive used it as a reader and used the web to check email and use google i havent yet tried movie streaming as i rarely seem to have time for that since my wife tends to monopolize my ipad this serves as a nice second tablet to have around since i dont use a smartphone i appreciate having a camera available without having to always truck my slr around,positive
511,i was gifted a kindle fire tabletand i loved it everything about it is good i love how it works but i cant send and receive file via bluetooth to other devices android and laptop though this kindle fire doesnt have an external sd so i was kind of sad because some apps are so memory consuming the camera i loved it despite not having a high resolution i love that its brightness of the captured pictures are awesomebut so far this device is good,positive

513,very misleading advertising on the amazon siteany expectation of sending live tv to your large screen set will not be metoh yes you can call customer service and aftertechs and a supervisor they probably will tell you to buy a fire stick to solve the problemif you do we did it does no goodthe only thing you can send is amazon prime that you have no need to send anywayyou can hard wire the hdto a big screen with the cable matters cableit worksforget about wireless transfer,negative
514,i got this kindle fie and i must say im very impressed by the color display the sound quality at times the camera freezes upbut all in all this little guy works wonders i get to watch movies in bed and it connects well with my cell phone hot spot with internet sharing app on my phone so i get free internet where ever i amwas worth the pricea bit heavy and bulky but okay to manage i love this kindle fire hd it was a great decision to purchase it,positive
515,before ordering this item i read over everything it had to offer and then made a decision i knew going in that it was going to be smaller but its perfect for what i wanted it for it is primarily going to be used for reading and watching videos i do have a few other apps downloaded however i did noticed that there are some apps that are not yet compatible with the fire hdim sure this will change the longer it is out some people mentioned that they had issues with the touch screen not recognizing when they tap on something but i havent had a problem with mineoverall it works great and i love it just going to patiently wait for more apps to become available for it,positive
516,so far so good fits my old case perfectly love minei dont use a cell phone i have one but its a toasts away where you buy minutes just for emergenciesi likemy kindlei was supposed to get it monday augit came early like tuesday or wednesday and so i wasable to chat with my husband while he was visiting his brotheri have to use speaker in a phone as im hearing impaired so i love my new kindlegreat price too and free shippingwhat a deal,positive

519,i previously had the fire hdfromand i needed an upgrade i decided to get the hdand even though the screen is a bit smaller it is soooo much better than the other one the picture is better the sound is better the speed and handling are better and the tablet looks better although i had this tablet for a total of three days now i think it is soon worth every penny and if you are thinking of getting this dont hesitate get it,positive
520,probably the best device ive ever owned i love technology and have owned many devices by far its very fluid and fast keep in mind you are tied to amazon for content but thats ok with me their services are great only complaint is that second screen is not hd when streaming prime videos but thats a problem with the prime service not the device get theinch with thegigs of memory its worth it as ive had problems with other android based devices slowing down when storage space gets low,negative
521,this is a good tablet for kids if you dont want or need a lot of bells and whistles and dont want to pay a premium for the more popular higher priced tablet out there my son loves the size bigger than a cell phone smaller than a pad and the camera he only uses it for reading games and taking picturesvideos my husband and i love the parental controls and that we can use it in a pinch too for checking our own emails or to use the internet,neutral

525,this tablet is a great deal for the price but it definitely isnt the best quality tablet you can have it runs slow and is laggy and i come across a lot of problems when downloading things online the system is kind of slow but then again its great for the price fantastic for watching netflix and reading it also has some pretty awesome features the front camera is really blurry but the back one is alright i also use this to skype my boyfriend over seas he has one too and he loves it,positive
526,note i received my fire hdjust yesterday so these are initial thoughtsive owned several previous kindles i have a paperwhite now as well as having owned several ipads this tablet foris decent the screen is actually nice to look at sharp and crisp enough ive noticed that reading on this device is more enjoyable than some other screens like an ipad or laptop so thats a good thing my one huge peeve right now is that the battery doesnt seem to last long at all i feel like i literally loseevery minute that would of course only allow the device to operate forminutes on a charge and im simply reading not running games or playing movies or music i dont know if i got a lemon or whatalso its taken somehours to charge fromtothat really is unacceptable given how quickly the battery fadesi will update this review in a few days should the battery deal changeupdate all is well i gave the fire a full charge tothough it did takehours the first time it had previously updated itself so i also restarted now the discharge rate seems on par with what the product advertises charging is also faster i do like this device and as ive said before reading on it is easier on the eyes somehow than an ipad or laptop i cant explain why though my only other woe is the weight its a bit heavier than i had anticipated all in all a rather nice device for the price,positive
527,its amazing how updated my amazon account and i can quickly feel with a custom tablet upload videos and audios quicklybut is a bit small screen for my taste in the functional part the best the high definitionthe worst sound and screen size,positive
528,it was a little smaller than i am used to but thats what makes it such a great ereader on the go if you like to read while traveling or commuting its size makes it very convenient such a handy tablet for a great price the camera is much better than expected and the screen is very responsive unlike some other tablets in this price range id recommend something like this for a young user its so much easier to grip than ainch tablet in short if you dont like to carry many items and consider tablets to be heavy or inconvenient this is perfect for you,positive
529,i will say this tablet has great features and it fits almost naturally in my hands but my biggest complaint is the software that it will not install the challenge i have with this tablet is i want to love it but i bought this with a clear purpose of using it for school yet it with not let me install google drive which i understand they dont want to use competition which makes it difficult when i am so used to google docs though i did find the solution by using its silk browser to get access to my google drive the browser is a bit clunky so i have decided to give amazons docs a chance the recreation apps that i have installed such as netflix are very smooth and high quality and the home screen is great it very easy to navigate and i can see myself using this tablet a lot the overall design of this product is functional the layout of the ports and buttons make it so nothing is squashed when i am using it just before bed or tossing it into my bag for school with other products having the charging port at the bottom which not only jabs the charger into you while youre in portrait but wears out the charging port and charger causing you to replace it numerous times it is a nice change for the camera on this tablet i would say it is decent nothing to complain about but not much to brag about i love the buttons they are all at the top in easy reach the microphone has great sound quality the battery life has lasted longer than anticipatedstarting at pm atand continuing toam never hitting belowthis is great product and if it goes on sale again i would buy it as a gift,positive
530,i didnt really need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive tablets out therethis is exactly what i was looking forit starts up fast the ad version is really easy to bypass and its not worth the extrato have this ad freeyou just skip the opening screen and then you get a great quality picture and can log on to the internet immediately as long as you have wifi which most places do nowi logged into a hotel wifi very easily and was actually able to view videos faster than on a laptop that i had with me at the time just to test the speedthe picture size is fine for me i didnt want to carry around another laptop size tablet this is exactly what it should be a tablet not a laptopit has access to all of the amazon products apps prime movies etcbeing a prime member this is very convenient to have as i have a ton of content that i can have access to and i dont necessarily have to download everythingyou can borrow a book a month for free from the kindle store and there are a lot of free apps that you have access to as wellim very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyoneif you need stereo speakers you would need to go up an additional level to the hdbut im very satisfied because if i need stereo i can just plug a headset infor underthis really cant be beati bought my wife a dell tablet about a year ago and it was aboutmore but this offers so much more as there is just so much content to access,positive
531,i do like the kindle fire hdgb as far a performancethe customer service rep went out of his way to try and help and it was delivered ahead of timei believe the rep was extra helpful bc i was trying to replace a kindle fire hdthat had gotten wethe gave me an excellent deal but i have hadissues since thenthe rep was trying to get me thebut said it wasnt being offered that day for some reason he didnt know whytoday i see a new kindle fire hdgb orgb is being offered for the same price i paid for thewhich was just delivereddays agothei got has no external expandable sd card slot like thewhich is expandable up togbreally wish i couldve gotten it insteadcalled customer support today bc i linked my kindle with another adult amazon account so that we can share amazon prime and wondered why i wasnt able to access the child videos we bought or uploaded in our separate accountsfound out its not allowed very disappointedplus i was transferred at leasttimes and gave up on the last rep who said dvds dont have digital files bc of drmhowever i have bought dvds that offer digital files with a given code and i didnt get the dvds via amazonhe was going to transfer me yet againvery very disappointed about not being able to share our separate librarieswhich i wanted available to our kids but i would have to deregister the kindle and reregister it to the other adults account to be able to view the one bought on his account but then thekids wouldnt be able to view the ones on my account plus i would lose whatever else i had stored on the kindle except for apps but i wouldnt be able to use those unless i reregistered the kindle back in my name i think itkinda defeats the point of sharing the accounts,neutral
532,i am pleasantly surprised by the tablet i have always used nexus tablets but mine broke and this was a much cheaper option the ui is super friendly reading on it surpassed the nexus by far its a bit thicker than i thought it would be and feels a bit cheaper than the nexus but no matter really would love expandable storage but oh well unlimited cloud storage is nice watching prime movies without wifi is a great plus screen looks great for the price you honestly cant beat it,positive
533,i like the kindle fire except for where the speakers arebehind it so when i lay it by my night table so my alarms will wake me i can hardly hear itthey are costly to fix a battery is abtcordsthe reason i had to buy a new one was because my old one wouldnt charge anymore so i needed a batter corda new charging port on the fire boooomight as well buy a new onewhich i didworks fine,positive
534,terrible have had issues since i bought it inly hadmonth warranty bought in november was a christmas gift by the time it got used warranty expiered january ndterrible experience and i have bought many kindles from here but this will be th last one,neutral
535,great little tablet just streamed a movie from amazon prime flawlessly video was definitely hd quality very user friendly and intuitive it was really easy to set up email etc size is like an oversized phone perfect for small hands like mine and unobtrusive when reading battery came fully charged which was nice because i was excited to use it great value for a student like me whos on a budgetthe only negative so far is that its a little heavy for its size but otherwise im very happy,positive
536,the fire hd i bought was a certified refurbished model as i was attempting to set up the the device it kept leading me to a screen to set up a kids device because of the software there was no way around this screen i decided to call customer service i chose the option that let customer service call me back they were very quick to call me back and then they promptly put me on hold for approximately three minuteswhen the first customer service agent i talked to answer the phone she was polite but did not speak understandable english in addition to this there was so much background noise in her call center she was all but worthless to talk toafter i was able to explain what the fire hd was doing she said im going to need to put you on hold so i can research this problem it took her approximatelytominutes to come back on the line after researching the problemafter she led me down the reset of the fire hd the problem was still not fixed and i landed right back onto the kids screenshe then put me on hold again and told me she was sending me to a kindle specialist seven minutes went by while i was connected to a kindle specialistonce again i was greeted by a different customer service agent a kindle specialist this time whos grasp of the english language was less than adequateshe told me three different times within the first minute that we were talking that she was going to address my problem when i finally said yes i understand that youre going to address my problem this is the third time youve told me this she said im going to need to put you on hold while i research this problem she finally comes back online and tells me no theres nothing we can do for you youre going to have to return itshe says im going to need to put you on hold to get your return set up at this point i snapped ive been put on hold six different times for a product that was in essence worthlessthis is by far my worst experience with amazon and not one that i care to repeat,neutral
537,i am basically an android person and because i teach a short course on tablets wanted to add a kindle fire device to my arsenaltheprice for the hdwas all i needed to purchase onethe quality and performance of the tablet is great but the limitations amazon puts on it are very cumbersomei use firefox with my other tablets and windowslaptop and i can synchronize them all to provide the same bookmarks and passwordsthe kindle world does not permit this browser to be used but i did find a way to install a copy of the chrome browser even though kindle will not permit me to synchronize it with my other devices that have chrome installed because i have to log into google to permit synchronizationthere are a number of other apps that can be found on google play that are not available on amazon and of course any part of the google infrastructure is prohibited on kindle devices unless one wants to root themand there are many apps in the amazon appstore that will work on other android devices but will not work on the kindle fire systemseven though the kindle tablets are really android amazon has so severely limited it and reorganized it that it becomes difficult to consider the os as androida purchaser of any of these tablets is totally dependent on amazon for anythingmaybe amazon will decide to open up the fires in future os upgrades but i doubt itill probably use the hdprimarily as a book reader in the meantime,neutral
538,i love the device but the camera does not take good pics the front camera is very fuzzy but the rear camera is clear this is one of the reasons i got this device can someone tell me if they experience the same thing one thing i can say is that the apps are great the hd quality is awesome but the last one i had was good too kindle fire hdx what i wanted was the frontrear camera and that what makes me very disappointed a little bit but still a good buy,neutral
539,i bought two of these one for myself and one for my boyfriend the first one i opened i had to work for a few hours to get it to connect to my wifi the second one still as of yet wont connect when i try to type on it it registers each single tap astaps so when i try to type hello it thinks i typed hhhheeelllllllloooo trying to backspace the extra letters also registers as multiple taps trying to add apps to the tablet kept giving me currently unavailable which may or may not be the tablets problem by the first day i had to factory reset the tablet twice and it still seems to be buggy trying to open the settings bar by pulling the bar down forget it it just thinks i am trying to zoom in or open the store i cant adjust anything to even see if there are options to fix my problems click to buy seems to think my credit card is invalid despite using it just a few days ago to purchase the tablet itself the second tablet works better except it refuses to acknowledge my wifi making it kind of pointless,negative
540,the fire hd is a great tablet for gamingreading listening to music being an amazon productaccess to services like kindleamazon musicamazon prime kindle unlimitedas well as a wealth of gaming apps in the app store makes this is a great tablet for adults as well as the kids the cons are fewfor the type of tablet the hd isnot much to care about its a little on the slow sideparticularly when downloading videofor instance the screen is a little on the small side the single speaker could be a little louder nowall those little things can be altered by you at the time of purchase the hd or hdx might be more to your liking if size is real important as for the hdit seems to be a good example of how great things still come in small packagesand now the new addendumnow the latter review still gos for methough i felt the urge to pass some info on that i missed i opted for the model that came with the special offers and that means whenever the device falls asleep you will be greeted by an add every time you reopenand this needs to be slid over to dismiss it and open to the home page you can avoid this by payingextra at purchasehave an add free os this is one of those little things i mentioned preaddendum that youthe purchasermake the call on before youve even spent a penny truthfullyim rising in defense of the fire tablet linein particularly on the add issue because buyers are complaining about it in their reviews and thats kinda unfairand im an applemacios fan here but i felt that since i do get so much use out of my kindle ereader that the fire hdeven if it is an android with sangria oswas my personal idea of a excellent upgrade for an ereader plus the fact that im just a big kid at heart an now i dont have to bring my ipad with me all the timeif i plan on just reading some of my comic book collectionnow easier to carry and in living color,positive
541,no google apps u can forget snapchat or instagram because u cant them or other most popular apps no google apps the screen locks most time to the point where i have to restart it so it can work again the only thing about it is its size,neutral
542,i thought id be able to use this as a reader toohowever its virtually impossiblethe font goes from tiny to large in just one clickthe tiny is too small to readthe large is just too big for the screen theres no flow to a line when there are onlywordsvery frustratingi think i will sell it on ebayits heavy too,positive
543,i have literally fallen in love with this nifty gadget here the kindle fire hdhas become my favorite over any of the other readers i have i received this in the cobalt blue and my first thought after pulling it out of the box is how sturdy it is made i like the design and look of the kindle fireand while it is a bit thicker than say an ipod it is still small enough that i can put it in my purse or my bible case etc it is very well made as i have already dropped it once and there were no problems that arose from the minor fallit is very easy to get the hang of using it and i like the carousel that pulls up whatever you used last everything you need is right there on the front page and i quickly found my way around the device there were only a couple things i didnt care for or i think they could use some tweaking the camera allows for picture taking but they often blur as you have to hold the device very still the only reason i dont really care a whole lot about this option is that my whole goal in the kindle is not to take pictures it was just something that i thought i should mention the other thing is that some of the apps in the amazon store cannot be used on the kindle fire hdsuch as the instagram one not sure why that is but i cannot get on instagram unless i go through the internet browser but that totally negates being able to take pictures and put them on instagram again not something major but kind of frustratingoverall though i love the kindle fire hdand it works perfectly for what i most need it for great to read books on watch movies or browse the internet while i am out and about i love it,positive
544,my nd fire hd love the size for me to carry the resolution is beautiful offersdoesnt really bother me video streaming is great and is not blurry i really dislike the fact that it can slip away from my hands bought a case does not have a sd card slot it is for light use too since is only gb from which can only use like gb so no much space to keep some games or movies very easy to use and good batteryhowever i recommend this product to people that like to keep it simple for reading movies and some gaming,positive
545,this is a great buy i just love it i can borrow books and audio books from the library and more things that i havent tried as yet i think anyone would be very happy with this kindle fire i know i am,positive
546,im not too thrilled with the way the childadult set up works there is too little information on how to not download every thing on the amazonfree app for example and the firehdkeeps filling up with automatically downloaded app that kick my kid off wifi as soon as the available storage gets too low we delete apps and the minute youre done they start downloading again have found no solution as to turning autodownloads off as yet,negative
547,ive had this device for over a year now having ordered it around when it was released last year for just aboutthis tablet delivers some serious performance while it lacks some surprisingly appreciable features like an ambient light sensor or upgradable storage space it is an extremely capable portable pocketable even in my skinny jeans tabletereaderweb browsergaming devicei must mention that the recently updated silk browser performs much better than the previous version i know some people are complaining about missing features but it actually loads pages now and at a reasonable speed browsing the web is now quite enjoyable on this devicei have two main gripeswhereas with my phone and main tablet which to be fair each cost at least x the price of this device i can dexterously tap the screen at the right spot for text input boxes icons keys on the virtual keyboard and links in the browser i feel like my kindles touch input is not wellcalibrated or at least not as intuitively sowhere is bellini fire osis great but fire oshas shipped on the newfires two months ago this tablet is still being sold so why hasnt an upgrade been made available,positive
548,it is great i would recommend the gb model for the ability to download playlists and movies for when you dont have a wifi connection the special offers i thought would be a distraction but it only comes up on the locked screen so i have come to enjoy the offers they show,positive
549,love my tablet wish it had bluetooth buuut cant have it all i guess excellent for what it is meant forpros fits in my purse easy to use good battery life while using i am an avid reader who had a hard time committing to using an ereader instead of a proper paper book but i am quickly converting over to the dark side well the light side the back lighting is adjustable and awesomecons battery still drains a fair bit when not in use which is to be expected i really should just turn it off when i am not using it but i do not remember all the timeupdate it does have bluetooth so apparently i can have it all,positive
550,love my new fire hdtabletthe color is bright and clear and it seems to work well with the interface i mostly use it to read digital books and love the different fonts when my eyes were bad i could still read on my kindle with the large font there is so much more here just have discovered all the other aps really a great buy highly recommend at a fair price thegb leaves a lot of room for music downloads and email and facebook etc,positive
551,the screen looks great ive also noticed a significant audio improvement when using the same headphones i use with my iphone however i cant recommend this device to anyone the battery life is abysmal and the charging cord that comes with the device is too short to be of any use i wanted to use this tablet mainly for reading ebooks comics and occasionally watching netflix or something when i didnt want to use my chromebook or disturb my so after spending a week trying my best to use this device i end up going back to my chromebook time and time again i wasnt expecting the very best at this price point but i regret purchasing this device because i can literally watch the battery percent tick down as i use it which i dont find to be very convenient,neutral
552,i didnt realize how much smaller thetablet is from thei had before icouldnt get it to connect to the wi fi yesterday while i was sitting with a patient at the hospitalotherwise it is nice the cover protectors were not of the quality i was expecting now i have buy a cover for the tablet but will have to wait awhile to spend more lol,positive
553,this tablet is greatand if you are a prime member this tablet is a must havefor a tablet underi was expecting something decent this far surpassed my expectations it is perfect for streaming movies and music playing games and surfing the web this replaced my much slower surface rt and i am very pleased i will say if you want something with a larger screen this is not for you however for my needs this is the perfect size,positive
554,i purchased thebecause i wanted to have a smaller venue for traveling and still getting my email and facebook i had an original kindle and wore it out this is so much nicerhave not used all of its capabilities partially ownercaused and partly because there are no instructions really with it i know they are online or so ive been told only had it a week but looking forward to learning more about it and then give itstars,positive
555,this is a great purchase for the price honestly for such a low price i wasnt expecting much i had heard a lot of backlash about this product first of all i love that i can choose the color i know it sounds petty but any sort of customization is ain my book today all the electronics are that sleek black color so it was nice to have something with a little pop next to my other tablet and cell phone my fire just screams to me and i feel chic and trendy ducking this into my purse since pinkpurples are a part of my signature colorsprosreally good battery life plus it came to me atto begin with so i didnt have to wait gorgeous screen quality everything is sharp bright and livelyeasy to access everything i turned it on and all my purchases were there waiting for me i just had to type in my email address and bam full access babyit has a rearfacing and forward facing camera there is no flash option so as a black woman i wont be taking any selfies outside but in the gorgeous summer sun i took plenty of photos which are now my backgroundthis also connected swiftly and easily to my wifi no problems on my end alas there are no google play apps but for the most part i have the things i use like facebook i wish spotify was there but it does in a pinch besides when im reading im not listening to music so its not a huge deal for mei personally love how cute and petite it is its small and compact without feeling glass fragile i hate having electronics that feel like if they even slip from your fingers its done fori think its a great little purchase for either a student or someone who uses public transportation easy to transport long battery life great screen im definitely going to enjoy this,positive

563,the fire hd is a good value depending on what you want to do with itit runs an amazon proprietary android os that only accepts apps from the amazon appstorethe availability of apps is reasonable but not comparable to the google play storethe built in speaker is fairly uselessusing earbuds the sound is only adequatevoice to text capabilities are haphazardly integratedthe silk browser has poor bookmark management capabilitiesand it lacks any file management system es file explorer app download is a good remedythe special offers are a small nuisanceoverall howeverand especially given the priceim pleased with it,positive
564,excellent tablet at a low low price ofnot including taxits great the screens is excellent a bit less resolution than more expensive tablets but due to its compact nature the screen looks better than it sounds very crisp and very clearbuy one buy two buy three buy four or five and there you go thats how much one ipad costsi am not a apple hater but after dropping my ipad and payingbucks for a new screen i got rid of itlow cost tablets are here and they are square or rectangle but its great its cheap and its onlybucks not including tax,negative

566,its a great tablet i bought it for myyear old daughter and a year later it still works great its been through drops and even myyear old putting it in the toilet a bowl of rice overnight and theres no damage the reason i ratedstars is because i think the battery life could be better and it doesnt have google play which is honestly the best online gaming store in my oppinion,positive
567,bought these as christmas gifts for my triplet girls i opened one and was trying it out since they wont be officially getting them until christmas this is a great little tablet fast strong battery life great looking screen i would recommend this product to anyone only downside i would say is that it is a little on the heavy side but thats the only thing i could find to be a downside,neutral
568,this a great tablet for the money ive been using it to replace a very laggy ipad pros great size for quick browsing or reading books with one hand extremely clear screen pretty amazed at this price point sturdy it has withstood multiple drops on tile without a single mark speedy the browsing on this is very smooth with almost nonexistant night and day vs my aged ipadamazon services music book video are woven into this tablet amazingly wellcons the gb storage is a bit rough without the sd card slot that some of the new models have restricted to amazon app store which while not bad at all still cant keep up with the play store doesnt work with chromecast which is frustrating as it seems more like a jab against google than some inherent tech shortfallall in all this is a great little table for those using tablets for browsing and media consumption which seems to be most people in truth the build quality and screen are great and you cant beat the value,neutral
569,thought i would use it to replace my ipad when traveling abroad so if something happened to it i wouldnt be out as much moneynow after traveling with the fire id rather take a chance of losing my ipadnot very impressed with the quality or usability of the fireglad i only spentthough it really isnt worth that much to me,neutral
570,this was too small to see well not much bigger than my phone the main reason i hate it though is that everytime i pick it up to use it the battery has gone dead very annoying i had an ipad and loved it but when it was shattered my daughter talked me into to trying a fire well i tried it unless amazon comes up with a tablet that sleeps i wont be buying another one back to overpriced apple for me come on amazon you can do better,negative
571,got this for myyear old was excited to use free time on itunfortunately even with using the cloud for videos and picture storage we dont have room to keep downloaded apps she has to switch them out constantly to make room it saysgb with her being the only user on free time no other apps downloaded no pictures books or music on it i literally deleted every possible thing i could to make room she is left withgb of usable storagegb is used up by system system apps storefronts for music books audio books etc that you cannot remove so that comes out togb free time is anotherso thatswhere is the other unaccounted forgb this was a waste of money plus im paying every month to used the free time even worse she used her own birthday money to buy it she actually prefers to just use my phone thats pretty sad if she hadnt gotten it in october i would return it but i think its too late,neutral
572,this device was purchased for a chronically ill little girl to pass time during hours long treatments after less than a year the sound stopped working not dropped or anything just unplugged from the charger as other reviewers have said their commercial is incredibly false adverstising customer service is a joke i spoke to three different people and was told three different things the first person had me do a factory reset on the device without warning me or making sure my files were backed up i know partly my fault but still and precious photos and videos were lost forever i first reported the problem while it was still under warranty but they dragged it out until it was no longer under warranty and then told me they wouldnt replace it unless i pay some service fee they have broken a sick little girls heart and pissed this momma bear off do not waste your time with them,negative
573,i think it is great for what i got it fori have a larger tablet and a smart phonebut they both have limited storagethe other tablet isjust a little too large to be able to stick it down in my purse tocarry around with meand i do not want to worry about running down the battery on my phonei can carry the fire hdin my pursethe other day i downloaded a movie from amazon prime to my fire tablet and took it with me when i had to have my car servicedit took them almosthours and i was able to pass the time watching the movie using my earbudsi also use it for readingi am very pleased with it,neutral
574,got the g fire hdon sale and a caseinsurance for our preschoolerive got it set up with aboutfree appsvideosbooks in amazon freetime which is free on every fire tableti got this size to be portable for doctor visits and long car trips and so hed leave the ipad alone the ipad has a nice feature that i can lock him in a certain app to playblock purchases but i have to unlock it to get to another app otherwise he has free reign of any apps on the deviceive never used an android device before but found the kindle setup to be easy and intuitive i easily downloaded a ton of free apps some kid shows books and approved them under his profile in amazon freetimebefore i let him have it i spent quite a bit of time playing with the apps to screen them and delete the ones that seemed much too difficult age inappropriate or didnt work properly unfortunately i found that amazon does not do a very good job of providing appropriate age suggestions for appshe really likes the kindle and it works well for what i purchased it formy only complaint is the battery life amazon said it should gethours mixed use this is not the case so far its maybethat when i was setting it up and testing apps and it seems to die pretty quickly when i stream movies in it if i unplug it fully charged in the evening its down tobattery life by morning with no usethis isnt usually much of an issue since i dont let my kid play with it for hours on end but when he played with it for an hour or so in the morning then it sat all day it did not have enough battery to make it through a car trip that evening and died aboutminutes into our tripi did a lot of research on kid tablets and decided on this one many of the other tablets have games forper appgame with minimal free games which would make them cost prohibitive or lacking variety or major problems with programming or charging ports etc the ipad mini seemed like a great choice too with lots of free educational games but the cost was just too much to spend on ayear old i definitely recommend the g over the g kindle as it filled up pretty quickly when adding shows and appsall in all i count it as a good purchase and would buy it again i really like the amazon freetime interface but i am more than a little disappointed with the battery life,neutral
575,dont buy a kindle and think that you own the ebooks yes i am yelling i am so mad and so tired of trying to get help from any tech or developer they locked me out of all my ebooks with drm for no reason at all and i mean all my ebooks i have tried for over three months to get any help to no avail yes i even emailed jeff bezos my kindle fire is worth so much trash and i have lost hundreds of dollars spent on ebooks that they wont refund buyer beware,negative

577,i love my tablet im a novice to the tablet world but this is great for surfing the web watching netflix and amazon video etc works perfect for what i bought it for the battery life seems to be good it did freeze up once i think it must have overheatedi have it in a protective plastic case and my toddler was watching a movie other than that no problems whatsoever,positive
578,the good very good tablet for its pricethe fire os is heavily modified from androidit might not be as good as a vanilla android on nexusbut it also has its perksit is easy to switch from the few recent activitiesand by activities i mean anything that you did on the tabletso i was reading a book listening to a couple of radio stations on amazon prime using a couple of appsall of them are on the ribbons very easy to accesssince it is a simple tablet you really dont use it much other than these few thingsthe ability to have them all in one place is intuitive easy to graspand the tablet does these few things nicelyalso i enjoyed the texttospeech feature greatlyi read a lot more books these days because i can listen to books now on my commutethe bad i had to side load a bunch of google apps like chrome google play store etci do not like that partamazon is too afraid of competition from google and scarified customer experience just to keep you in their ecosystemcome on,positive
579,i use the fire hdprimarily for reading mostly kindle and pdf books but also websites i found it superior to theandbecause it has the same resolution ofbut in a smaller area so the resolution is effectively higher itsdots per square inch which means that text is stunningly clear text looked a little blurred on theand i have used it occasionally for watching videos and it does just fine downloaded a few games but havent played them a sign language app worked great and it uses some sort of d rendering so the processor is okthe only thing close is the ipaid mini the mini with retina screens is faster so if youre doing mindless web surfing it wins because it loads pages faster likewise the ipads screen is a bit better but nottimes the price better the fire hdis by far the best tablet for this kind of money in my opinion,positive
580,much more than i expected,positive
581,i love my kindle and i could not imagine living without itthe operating system is a little buggy sometimes and i often have to reset it or may have to download a book more than once to actually have it on the device but there is not competing product that is any better so for now this will do just fine,positive
582,i only had this for a couple weeks and it keeps freezing on me only way i can go from bookgamebrowser to the home page is to completely shut it down besides the kindle freezing up in sure its great just not impressed with this,positive
583,its beenmonths since i have this fire and apparently its a good name for it i got burned figuratively its no longer taking chargemy money seems to have gone up in smokewould like to know what is my optioncould l send it back to get it fixed or preferrably replacedwho do i turn to or contact,positive
584,i would rate this half a star does not havegigs of space totally not what i was expecting a few months after owning this i had two of then sitting on my bed while i was folding laundrythey both dropped on my carpeted floor and both were in casesthe screens to them shatteredi contacted amazon about replacing the screens i was told they stand behind their products and would like to replace the deviceswell months later i never received the replacementsthen they tell me that they are not going to replace them unless i purchase an extended warrantythen a few days before my actually warranty runs up they both stop chargingi will never purchase from amazon again every since order i have placed there has been something wrong with shipment to or the actual item,positive
585,i absolutely love my firethis is a step up for me from the original kindle fire i have the first addition of it and it still works like a dream only reason i upgraded is because i was running out of programs that will work with it so on the firei run my video apps and on my original kindle fire i run my books and i couldnt be happier,positive
586,i ordered the gb but gb is reserved for the system memory so only gb is available for local storage the touch screen is a little slow to respond and the sound is not great all said i would keep it for the price if it had memory expansion capabilities it getsstars from me because i can not upgrade memory,negative
587,very nice for a young childa bit heavier than i expected but really nice clear images and endless variety of optionslove the fact that i can provide books music games internet access and so much more in this one small deviceterrific storage solution i am pleased with the purchase and the customer service as wella great christmas gift,positive
588,i like the smallness and lighter weight but it keeps kicking me out of my games which my kindle fire hd didnt do it drives me crazy to be playing a game and then all of a sudden my game shuts out and my screen goes back to the carousel screen and i have to reload my game also the back gets hot after its been on foror so minutes i find myself just going back using my iphone,neutral
589,tablet is certainly worth the money i like the functionality the weight and appearance only dislike is the color its washed out and not very vibrant dont know if this is the situation with all of these devices or if its just the one i got i compared it with my samsung galaxy s phone and it wasnt even close i turned up the brightness and that didnt help,positive
590,i liked the fireso much i wanted the hdit is smaller than theand therefore easier to carry i slip it in my pocket and away i go i think its great i have not had any issues with either tablet others have mentioned,positive
591,i find the size to weight ratio difficultfor instance my kindle is larger and lighter and therefore easier to use my ipad is larger still and weights more but still easier to usethe fire has the weight of the ipad but its more concentrated making it more cumbersome to usei would not buy another fire,negative
592,im getting bruised knuckles trying to select items touching for a long time sometimes works sometimes i need to strike it sharply with my knuckle when reading though it responds quickly to the stroke of a fingerthe keyboard is not aligned with the touch screen if i touch the center of a key and actually get something to happen i usually get the letter to the right of that keyalthough i did upgrade the os toi have not been able to turn on blue shade cant find it and it is one of the main reasons i bought this it says to tap blue shade on the quick actions menu doesnt say where that menu is if it is the center pull down there is no blue shade on it ive explored settings and display not there eithernavigation of the help menus is tricky the lines are very narrow and i usually get the one below the one im trying to selectan other claim was that it is possible to use the usb to transfer books from your system to the tablet well only if you have wifi to get the device set up i had planned to transfer content from my main machine ended up buying a router to get wifi in my home dont need it for anything else and no i cant use the usb to transfer books and audible books from my main machine to the tablet before i upgraded the os there was a way to go from online mode to device mode and it seemed to claim it was possible to transfer using the usb when i try to select the usb symbol on the top of the screen nothing happensall in all barely useable very slow download of books and yes i can read them but not if i want to read in bed and still sleep,negative
593,i have no complaints about the fire hd tablet the images are crystal clear and better than my android table i bought the fire to replace my kindle which finally quitthe screen does washout in bright sunlight but not as bad as my androidall the apps that i had on my android were found in the fire systemif i had it to do over i would buy a larger screen in hd,neutral
594,worthless if using as a tablet my child owns this along with the freetime case the freetime app is worthless if you want to buy bonus content on apps for your child its not compatible with the freetime app so you have to let them play on the main profile which defeats the purpose of having this device for the parental controls you cant customize the background or home screen you cant change settings without being connected to wifi no expandable storage im not sure why somebody would make an gb tablet then not put a sd card slot in it kindle app store is lacking compared to google play and apple what childrens apps you can find for free you have to pay to unlock features to make them even worth playing but like said above you cant make any in app purchase for the childrens profile there are quite a few apps that have to be paid for despite being free on google play the operating system is very restricted im not sure if its a bare bones android os or what but if you are use to using a samsung or other android device it comes off as very restrictive and frustrating im also not sure why it has a camera if once you take pictures you really cant do anything with themif you are looking for a cheap tablet for your child get a cheap off brand android if you are looking for a tablet with parental controls get a samsung galaxy i absolutely love my kindle email reader but amazon should put a little more effort into thier tablets or just not make them at all,neutral
595,this product is the biggest piece of junk i have ever purchasedthe cons greatly outweigh any positivesthe only positive comment i can make is for the size of the device however regardless of the compact size it is very heavyi played with this device fordays before i returned it to amazonthe cons the touch screen is either not sensitive enough or too sensitive swiping up and down was unpredictable in terms of whether it would show the controls to return you to the home screen at times it would randomy send me to another app or close the one that i was currently using the screen would occasionally freeze during use on daythe device refused to power onfinally after holding down the power button for at leastminute it decided to boot the volume is barely above a whisper apps that worked on my kindle paperwhite cannot be used on this device the battery was dismalminutes after using it the power was down to this device was a huge disappointment and i couldnt get to the ups store fast enough to return itfortunately amazon has great customer serviceput your money towards an ipad,negative
596,the device updated several times the firstdaysmostly without interuptionit seems responsive and i have no issues with itupdatethe wifi drops signal frequentlyi have full signal on my phone and on my nexusyet only receivewifi bar while sitting in the same placesometimes i have no signal,neutral
597,received hd as a gifthave been unable to connect to wificalled amazon for tech helpi was on the phone for almost an hour and the solution was to buy apackage to fix my network problemi was frustrated and very disappointedthe hd is back in the box,negative
598,been having issues with the touch sensitivity since purchasedbought my sister the cheaperand it is much easier to usebought to use during hospital stay after surgery but after having to touch it several times to go backhomeetc it has been more frustrating than anythingwish i had exchanged it i think my time is up as of now,neutral
599,i bought this while it was on sale forwhich is a pretty good deal this tablet is ok at doing what i use it for which is mainly just to browse youtube or watch netflix in bed the screen quality is pretty clear and the battery life is ok if i am just watching videos straight for many hours a day it will probably last me abouthours before i will run to charge it and i charge it before the battery fully runs out i also like the weight because it makes me feel like the product is more sturdy the camera sucks but who would take selfies with thismy main complaint with this product is the lack of apps i mean i knew it wouldnt be like my iphone but it lacks basic apps like instagram and the youtube app is not that user friendly it looks like there are plenty of games available though maybe a lot of people are buying this for their kids since the price is right so while i dont think its comparable to the level of an ipad at all its good enough for people who are just casual internet browsers and it seems sturdy enough for children i might not recommend it for a tech savvy teenager,positive
600,i was lucky enough to buy this at the gold box price ofplus a little more for no adds and more memory which i could probably have done without it was a xmas gift for my wife her first tabletat that price it really is the tablet steal of the century almost a handheld but the screen is large enough to read books on i especially liked the dual camera feature though why the resolution lags that of mobile phones escapes mei bought a refurbished hd a while ago with special offers and it has never worked very smoothly i think the hd may have upgraded the os and the browser seems much betteri have nothing but praise for kindles and confess a hearty dislike for microsoft and apple but ill add a couple more things for amazon to think about the second port on thehd has disappeared and it was useful and there should be some better deal done to provide google apps the choice is so much wider and sideloading is far from a perfect solution amazons unique android variant seems to be limiting rather than an advantage this is an outstanding product that would hold its own admirably on an open playing field,positive
601,do not like the ads and whispersync has a glitchof time it stops everypages and cuts off unless you leave the case open which runs down the battery loved my first kindle it had none of these problems now i am rethinking my recent purchase what happened to quality,neutral
602,my eleven year old daughter has desperately wanted a tabletafter hearing about the parental controls with amazon freetime we thought the kindle fire hd would be a good fitwe are really disappointed in several ways on black friday amazon had a special offer ofoff the kindles so we decided to purchase for christmaswe had no knowledge that ultimately that means you receive a kindle with advertisements that pop up as soon as the kindle is turned on or unlockedone of which was a scary monster figure that upset my daughterwe found out the only way to stop these was to pay yes you read correctlyto remove these from the kindlei find that completely absurd and deceptive of amazon and we have been big amazon customers in the pastsecondly the freetime parental controls are not as good as they soundyes we liked that it had a timer to close down after sayhours of playor that you can set it to have reading time first before game timeand the blocks are complete there is no way a child can get on the internet or watch an instant video or youtube or even listen to music when logged into freetimebut even if a parent decides that music is appropriate or an instant video is appropriate or that she can watch an animated movie you cannot alter those restrictionswhich is not great for even a sheltered eleven year oldunless you log in as an adultand then even if you block most itemsthe child has access to your settings and some things that cannot be blockedknowing what we know now we would not buy the kindle fire hd again as a tablet unless you are buying for yourself mostly as an ereader and then letting a smaller child like underyrs old occasionally play games or read on itas a third note the camera is poor as well,negative
603,i love the fire hdhdand fire tv that we ownthey work great and i am hookedmy star rating should be somewhere closer tostarsthe reason i am not givingstars is because amazon advertises a fling feature which is not available on the hdor after speaking to customer service they said that its only available on the hdxamazon needs to create a software patch for the hdandto enable this featurein the interim they should change the marketing text on the website to accurately reflect which devices can handle this featureheres how the site readssecond screen enhanced with xray click the “fling” icon on your fire phone or tablet to send video and audio to your big screen leaving you free to use your amazon mobile device for other tasks with second screen learn more about tv shows and movies playing on amazon fire tv with amazonexclusive xray powered by imdb dive deep inscene to explore characters trivia music and more when you’re done watching simply bring everything back to your tablet with a touchamazon fire tv also supports standards like dial so you can also fling services like youtube spotify and coming soon netflix from your android phone or iphonemirror your tablet or phone on your hdtv share whatever is on your screen including movies tv shows music and photos from your compatible tablet or phone with everyone in your living room using display mirroring what you see on your fire os or android device is exactly what you’ll see on your big screen including support for devices from motorola samsung lg and google without any additional apps or software,positive
604,i got this as an upgrade for my kindle paperwhite and talk about an upgradefirst off i love the sizeim a small person so the size is comfortable for me to hold while i read check facebook and play games even with the caseits very light so you can easily hold it in one hand while usingi havent watching much video on it but the graphics for the game i played was gorgeous and images look very crisp and clear the one thing that is a little disappointing is that unlike thethedoes not allow you to have the option for removable sim card storage but you do have amazon cloud storage so take that for what you willoverall this is a fantastic tablet for the price especially if youre looking for a tablet thats very portable and easy to use,positive
605,i was actually very disappointed when i received my fire it is much smaller than i anticipated i have a galaxy s with theinch screen and the fire is not much bigger my dad was given a fire regular not hd as a gift a few years ago and he loved it and it did too which promoted me to buy one of my own i immediately felt like i had wasted my money it did not have the same sleek feel that my dads fire did just the opposite in fact it was a bulky cheap plasticas for the performanceit lags quite a bit if there is any app or game installed it freezes often as well i should have returned it but i decided to give it some time it has not gotten any better i never use it so i now have apaperweight,neutral
606,it does what i want it to do which is primarily watching moviesthis replaced a nexusand is much faster with better battery lifei understand it is sold so cheaply to keep you moving towards amazon apps but the silk browser leaves a lot to be desiredi was able to install firefox so im good,positive
607,the kindle firehd is the go to tablet for anyone it packs quality and function ability in a great size tablet that is easy to pack in any on the go bag the kindle fire hd delivers a quality picture with crisp and clear attention to details the six inch tablet is the perfect size for watching movies television shows playing games or reading your favorite book or magazine and with the convenience of amazon you can do it all with the kindle fire hdthe kindle firehd has gb of storage so you will have plenty of room for apps games movies books and photographs it sports a two megapixel rear facing camera that takes p video and allows for high definition photos you are also able to choose from five different color choices so you can pick one that fits your personality the kindle fire has smooth operating software and you are able to move from one activity to the next with effortless ease and apps games and movies have no trouble playing smoothly with little buffering timealthough the size of the kindle fire hdis pretty convenient for travel and easy to pack in any bag the screen is somewhat small for movie watching you can still enjoy movies and television episodes but some might find a larger screen to be more appealing for that sort of viewing the kindle fire hdallows for smooth web browsing and emailing as well which is nice for work or school purposes overall for the price it is definitely a tablet that delivers in performance and would most likely satisfy someone looking for a quality tablet without having to break the bank,positive
608,mydaughters got these as gifts over a year agowe love themwe even used theyear worry free warranty and returned them when they started malfunctioningwarning be careful when sending it back our packing instructions said to include all chargerscords and accessories and even referred to the kindles by the kids case colors i did what it said and included the cases and chargersthey were returned without the chargers or caseschargers were sent to us free of chargei am still having a problem getting replacement casesthis occurred in august and its now almost decembercalled today and the customer service employee is having a hard time getting what im trying to explain we just want kids cases to protect the kindles,neutral

611,so happy with this i already have a kindle fire but bought this due to price and size i love having this with me commuting to work on the subway as it is so small even thought it is small the quality of video is great i mostly use it for reading though and it is well suited for that the screen is easy to read and it is so comfortable to hold really the size of a paperback book would recommend this to anyone,positive
612,i had an early kindle fire several years old now itself battery does not last all day with heavy use so i bought this one it is much smaller and lighter and faster plus it has twice the storage space so i never run out of room when i add an app i am very pleased with everything about this kindle fire good value and fun to use,neutral
613,its ok i just got as a backup to one of my backups can never have enough drives just make sure to go on youtube and look up how to install google play store on amazon tablet the video has to be the most recent because amazon changes their os with each new tablet or yearly i think anyway this allows you to download other apps,positive
614,i love my new fire hdtabletim more impressed with the bang that i received for my buck i own an ipad and an ipad mini as well i must say my ipads werent cheapdont get me wrong i love them and they have an amazing app store but they werent cheapi was a little skeptical to order the fire hdtablet because ive never owned a kindle device beforei was looking for something compact to fit in my purse on a regular basisi didnt want to spend a lot on another devicei wanted something reasonable and of a good qualityi got this device on sale forif you are looking for something that is exactly like the ipadipad mini you arent going to get all of the same apps as featured in apples app store but i still found enough to utilize my fire in a successful mannermy fire is just as close to my ipads in other areas streaming moviesshowsbooks ability to download music etc i know it says you can fit it in your pocket but as a female i dont see howits way bigger than my pocket but im ok with that because it fits compactly in my pursethe outer shell of the fire is very sturdy with a beautiful magenta colorwhen i first received it i thought a case was already attachedthe only reason i purchased a case was to protect my screen all of my books are in one place and i dont have to worry about carrying a heavy device back and forththe text to speech feature which is free in your settings has become my favorite while driving i also love that i have the ability to use the freetime feature with my daughter she has a completely different screen and is only able to view kid friendly informationshe took a picture of herself and when i logged back into my screen there was a notification letting me know that she was taking pictures i also received a preview of the picture she took she has tons of books apps games and shows available please keep in mind that this feature is free fordays and after that available for abouta monthim still on my trial period but i think i will keep iti would definitely recommend this device to anyone trying to get a tablet at a reasonable price,positive
615,poor power management battery drains when there is no app being used all background drainpoor space maintenance per user the device actually prevents management of data on it resulting in the device constantly running out of memorytouch screen as swipe reading issuesi truly wanted this to be a device that my child could learn to use but instead it just showcases all of androids inherent flaws,negative
616,this is a great tablet for the price the user interface is not as smooth and clean as for example apple ios but it does the job i like the compact size i have an older kindle that i love for reading except when im sleeping over with friends and want to read at night the backlight on the fire solves that problem for me if you use markups a lot in kindle like i do you will find the fire markups a bit clunky and inaccurate after you figure out how to access them for the moment im using the fire a lot for reading but may go back to the traditional kindle for heavyduty reading app downloads are fast and simple i also wanted something portable for showing my photos this does the trick for that as well,positive
617,i paid extra to get the gb rather than the gb version and im constantly running out of memory you see gb becomes gb of available storage after the partitioning but gb of the gb is taken up by system leaving gb of actual usable storagethe upshot is that after adding a very modest amount of other stuff it cant hold enough video to get through a long flight back it goes,negative
618,wish i had not bought this i wanted to download movies and play on trips but not enough memory to download much and cant figure out which cable to buy to hook to tvs it needs better instructions and seems difficult to understand i thought just hooking to wifi would be ok but that has posed alot of problems too thinking about taking a class to understand how to work this the way i had planned,neutral

621,the kindle fire hdis a weird combination of delightful and horriblelets start delightful i got a smoking deal on it at christmas time but having used it its probably worth every penny of the list price the build quality is solid the screen is nice and the size is just at the edge of something i can palm imtallits a solid ebook readeri still prefer eink for long sessions reading plain text but its a great way to read technical books with code samples or illustrations its a great games machine probably the best experience ive had playing colossatron angry birds star wars and monument valleybut when its horrible its a doozy it freezes or crashes at least once a weekthere are an astonishing number of touch targets that are way too small including things you use every day like the x to clear search fields the built in amazon silk browser routinely flakes out and doesnt open links from other apps like twitter and feedlythe amazon store doesnt include any mainstream browsers like firefox or chrome or a youtube app and youtube in the silk browser is awful the pinterest app feels aboutyears behind the pinterest app on iosany icon on amazons proprietary home screen that isnt a square look like garbageso its absolutely the besttablet and a way bettergames machine than anything nintendo or sony have ever madean ipad is a better flat out tablet but im not sure its x better like the price would dictate,positive
622,i gave them out a christmas gifts and everyone loves tablets they arent the best but they are cheap and are easy to use plus they are really easy to find uses for them plus there is enough space on them to hold enough movies or music to make it something fun to have around,neutral
623,this is the best tablet i have ever ownedi cant believe the priceit has everything i need and then morei just need to figure out space for my downloaded movies and then i will be even happieri fly a lot so having some shows on the device instead of cloud is importanti have been researching tablets for the lastyears and i really wanted to be able to have remote access to my work and school and at the same time have access to my amazon and other social media and appsi absolutely love thisit is also very fasti could give itstars if i couldbecause it uses android i can even take my skype classes on blackboard collaborate especially when i am on the goi use technology but cant say i am the most tech savvy person eitherit is really easy to use especially since it comes with certified frustration free packagingi chuckled at that when i saw the packagingbut it really is the best tablet i have ever ownedi dont mind the advertisements because i buy a lot from amazon anyway so it does not bother me one bit to see advertising if it makes my device cheaperalso you only see advertising when you turn on your kindleonce you get to the home page you will not see ads or promos like i thought i would based on previous reviews not being clear on where the ads are ati bought another one for myyear old nephew and he wont put it awayespecially since it is connected to amazonwe have been able to purchase so many kid friendly books eg the animated action hero biblei cant even begin to describe how happy he is to read books on his tablet that have visual and soundall hail amazonupdate i love the kindle so much i now havekindles for my family members and will be buyingmore next monthwe all love our kindles and use them dailymyyear old nephew charges and depletes his battery daily because of how much he usesitbest purchase everworth every penny thank you amazon,positive

625,look elsewhere or keep saving your money this tablet sucks it is so slow anytime i need to use the keyboard it takes a few minutes to load the keyboard and after every letter you type you have to wait a minute to type the next letter or else this tablet wont register that you typed that letter every time i have to type in a password i have to retrytimes it also always chooses the wrong letter i will hit i but it will type u i know its not me because on my smallinch phone i can type fine it takes forever to do anything on this tablet it also freezestimes a day i am constantly going on websites and trying to click stuff but nothing happens i cant exit out or anything i have to turn the tablet completly off then back on and hope it can load the internet page properly this time all i wanted to do was go on the internet and this tablet couldnt even do that piece of junk,neutral
626,do not buy this product real problem with internet connection go to any forum on dchp error and you will see how common it is all my other devices connect with no problem so it is definitely this device amazon need to sort this out soon,neutral
627,i got this within theday shipping period i ordered which i was extremely excited about its a great product i am not a huge tablet person but i do love reading off of thisits perfect for my hand size i have extremely small hands and for reading at night though i do use a screen dim app since the lowest brightness is too bright for me in pitch darkness i admit if i was looking for a full tablet function i wouldnt have gotten a kindle but may have spent the money for an ipad i use this kindle for reading and reading only though sometimes i look up things online with the silk browser which i have no complaints about all in all i paid for exactly what i wanted a tablet for reading i was between the paperwhite and the fire and this was actually less expensive and provided a bigger bang for my buck i considered the paperwhite because it functions only as a reader however the pages on a paperwhite have to reload every now and then in which the screen inverts itself and sort of looks glitchy this was a huge deciding factor when choosing the kindle fire hd in addition to the price difference i am proud of this purchase and would recommend,neutral
628,not sure if this will show up as a verified purchase have had some issues with that in the past but it is my fire i got it this afternoon and i do love it just a couple of thingsfirst amazon doesnt make it clear that only the items you have purchased from amazon directly will autotransfer to the fire from the paperwhite also collections the things that look like folders on the paperwhite do not transfer at all i verified this with kindle support my biggest disappointment is that i am unable to read from the fire in direct sunlight the paperwhite is readable in any light thats the reason forstars instead ofi was going to give my paperwhite to my mom but since the fire doesnt have the same readability ive ordered a new paperwhite for my mother and will keep mine i will have my daughter who has sent me aboutbooks via my kindle email resend all of those to both my fire and to my moms new paperwhite this week but that is really a pain and again i didnt find anything in my research that said that only purchased items transfer my last con is that the screen shows fingerprints and really i see that as an issue with every tablet ive picked upno fingerprints ever on the paperwhite if the tablets are touchscreen you get fingerprintsreally seems like there should be an answer to this particular issue now the pros the screen is gorgeouscolors are finely tuned and while it seems small its so clear that watching tv or movies on it is a great experience it is not too heavy and i will use it for reading indoors for those items that i have purchased since it will keep my place in the book across both devices or so i am told i dont have the cover yet but i anticipate that it will increase my satisfaction in terms of holding the fire in one hand it is extremely easy to use right out of the box short tutorial walks the user through the features quickly and efficiently it feels like a quality tablet is sturdy and while some have said the corners are sharp they look rounded to me downloading installing and uninstalling apps is very easy and the device is very quick so far i love it with the few exceptions i mentioned i will update if i find more pros and cons feel free to askme any questions regarding the fire or the paperwhite,positive

631,i have a few kindlesreally have had no real problems with any of them i bought this one for my grandson for christmas last year my mom got myyr old daughter a kindle i thinkyears ago she had some issues at school with reading but after she got her kindle i couldnt believe the improvements shed made so i got my grandson one hoping it would help him in the same way it did after getting him this kindle it seemed fine but then started flickering a couple times then would turn off for no reason and about wks ago it turned offwouldnt turn on again he was so upset so thank god i had a few dollarswas able to get him another one financially set me back but worth his education my only issue is that i thought after ordering the new one oh man i wonder if theres a warranty after all its only been a couple months and now its broke well front page says the return window closed on jan right under that it says warranty window will expire on dec i go onto read the return policy and it as well as the two previous sentences above are very confusing i have purchased so much from amazonthird party sellers of amazon never have i had an issue till this return policy i like amazon just wish theyd clear this uprealize items such as electronics need to be returnedwhen theres an issue even if its only been been a few months after purchased,neutral
632,i have been a kindle believer for aboutplus years with a keyboard kindleso i was excited to start using the fire hdit is great in many ways i like being able to do emailing on the same device as i can web surf and read books the downside is the battery life i have to charge pretty much daily and i am not watching tv or moviesor playing games which you can also do on this device my old kindle can go for about a month or more without charging buying books and getting library books work about the same way as my first kindle i really wish there was a way to remove books from the cloudi like being able to remove from device but then they all stay in the cloudeven the library books which i find kind of annoying it is nice to have both the front and rear facing cameras however the quality of both are not greatbut i knew this going into the purchase and do not expect to use it for pictures very often i do like the lightweight quality and ease of use for reading alsoappreciate having it back lit so i do not have to have a light on when reading at night etcunfortunately there is quite a glare when reading in sunlight the size of the actual screen is about the same size as my original kindle all and all i am quite pleased with the purchase and the price was very good i did get thegb even though thegb probably would have been enough for mainly reading books,positive
633,i am fairly impressed with the fire hdthe display is much sharper and crisp than i was expecting and the intuitiveness of the user interface is quite impressivethe touch screen is not as responsive as other tablets ive used but is adequate for the apps and activities im performingit is a bit thicker that some other tablets but not too cumbersomefor a smaller portable tablet it does fit the bill and atyou really cant beat the pricethe amazon app store is still limited in some of its offerings but again i was using simply to access amazon prime apps and files remotely so it works fine battery life is very impressive and the ads on the front screen during sleep mode are not bothersome at allim assuming they may even become useful as it learns more of what i search and use on the tablevery pleased with my purchase,positive
634,updatereview revised tostars after using for over a year the tablet is more responsive than it was out of the box likely due to software updates i am enjoying the ability to email pdf documents straight to my kindle the speaker is decent for audio books and as of tonight i am currently most grateful for the find my kindle featureupdateive revised my review up to three starsi was incredibly frustrated when i wrote the original reviewi still think this kindle is heavy and too thick to be comfortable for extended onehanded usethe screen is not very responsive compared to what i am used to on my cell phone and my nd gen kindle hdbut forthat is probably to be expected and it does seem to have improved slightly over the past couple of weeks though maybe i was just so frustrated when i first got it that i was overly sensitive to other drawbacksfor the price it is not terrible but some small improvements would make itstars at this price the one big plus of course is the overall small sizethis fits easily into my smallish purse whereas my other kindle had to be carefully maneuvered to fitfor that reason and because of the small price tag i am keeping this one instead of trading up to a bigger modelas suggested by another reviewer i decided to splurge on the leather cover instead of a plastic one even though i really wanted the red colori got the standing cover that is made specifically for this kindle because of the openon closedoff feature that i love on the cover for my older kindlenow that i have used it for a couple of weeks i see what the other reviewer was saying about the leather being more comfortable to hold than the plastic covers the leather is softer and apparently the edges are more roundedsince this kindle is relatively heavy and thick i think the increase in comfort that comes from the leather cover is worth spendingmoreoriginal reviewi really wanted to love this kindle but so far that is impossible first it is heavy and thick for something that is supposed to be easy to read one handed it does not come closemy hand tires too quickly and i have to keep switching handsnext up the touch screenmuch of the time it is completely unresponsive i just bought this and have barely downloaded anything so it cant possibly be a memory issuecontent deliveryi subscribed to two blogs two days ago and they have yet to show up when i try to get them delivered i am told i need to update my software to the latest version but when i try to update i am told i have the latest version and that no updates are availablei am a huge amazon user and love my nd generation kindle fire hdi was hoping for something i could hold easily in one hand while using but this is not it,neutral
635,this tablet is an excellent purchasewhile supposedly refurbished you would new kniw itthe tablet is fast and very responsive and charges extremely fast strongly suggest you purchase a case for the tablet to offer more protectionthis tablet should be considered the buy of the year,positive
636,did not like the new kindle fire hd at all it over heated to much some of my apps dont work it freezes and laggs terrible over all a poor producti wanted something better than the kindle fire i currently own that has several issues but i appreciated it much more after a couple days on this device,neutral
637,had the very first kindle fire tablet and decide to get one for my brother its beenmonths since have i have bought and given it to my brother it has work just as great as when i first gave it to him i opted for thegb version because lets be realisnt even remotely goodjust cant figure out why amazon is selling fire tablets with worse specs then the fire,neutral
638,for years it seems like every new device that comes out is more delicate from the last and ive heard many people including myself complain about broken screens and cases but that definitely isnt the case with the hdive dropped this thing on concrete tile laminate hardwood you name it and the worst that has ever happened is that a corner of the backing pops out of the side restraint the only drawback i have found with this tablet is the limited memory with only five gigabytes much of which is taken up by the operating system and necessary programming leaving the user with only aboutgigs but if youre looking for a tablet for anyone accident prone hint kids this is definitely your best bet unless they tend to drop electronics in the toilet which i have no idea how this would respond to that,neutral
639,it was a great price and it was a gift to momso they can keep up with all the latest gadgets and games portability and time passer while waiting for dr visits still works well and great battery lifeim writing this cause just reset it its been a year or two and works well but still strange on appsbut great product for the price,positive
640,have not had the kindle firefor long and am not very adept in the smart devices so i cant give a comprehensive evaluation on every featurewent from kindle keyboard to kindle fireso a main consideration was the ereader featureso far the ereader has worked well in terms of readabilityhavent tried reading in full sunlight yet so cant speak to glare issues i read about during research but just for ordinary indoor light and light from windows glare has not been too much of a problem although i occasionally have to move the firefor better visibilityfor me some of the features for controlling the document were easier in the keyboard such as the go tofor changing location in the ebook and changing the font sizeit has been very convenient to have access to internet maps music videos and other such features which was why i chose the fireinstead of another dedicated ereaderthe touch screen aspect sometimes seems too sensitive where a slight touch shifts me to a different screen and sometimes seems not sensitive enough where i need to touch an icon several times before i apparently hit the right spot to activate italso still having some trouble navigating the different screens and features but that probably goes back to not being very adept with smart devicesfor my uses the kindle fireis working out wellhope this review helps,neutral
641,i expected to use the tablet only with the cardio blood pressure monitorboth work well and the monitor gets my attention a good thingmuch to my surprise i like it as kindle replacement as well as for all the other capabilitiesi should add thati am fortunate to have a techsavvy son to set it up as it was way beyond my skill level,positive
642,i dont go in a vehicle without it we travel a lot and i have found that this has been a lifesaver both for books and amazon videos love the offline videos that change out periodically introduced me to new shows that i have begun binge watching on prime now in addition to my netflix addiction perfect size for me,positive
643,i already own several android pads but i got the kindle fire because the packaging is nice and because i wanted a reader primarily and the rep of the kindle is goodso far so goodheres what i discoveredthere is no provision for expanding the storage actually built inno sd card reader as most android devices have and im constantly running low on internal memoryim also an audible subscriber for nearlyyears and like to store more than one audio booktough luckif you got this fire with special offers included this sounds like a great feature rightnot necessarilyamazon lowered the price because the kindle is partly adsupportedto get them turned off you have to pay them an additionaland you have to move them offscreen to get on with what you want to dothe kindle app store does not offer a google play appok so they dont want to promote the competition but the amazon app store does not cover the waterfrontyou you can get into google play via the browser but who needs it if youre busyby the way on my other android pads i have hooks to both sites installedin short look before you leap in buying these devicesthe battery life by the way is accurately statedexcellentin all fairness,neutral
644,purchased for one of the seniors in our church as her first piece of technology she caught on quickly and enjoyed learning how to use it through our seniors and technology small group she loves being able to read in the adjustable font and play her games on it we even got her to set up an email address and respond to emails on it overall a great product for any level of user,positive
645,nice weight better to read than i thought however the sound leaves a lot to be desired i cant hear it if anything else is on and will only able to use it with earphones as i use it mostly for listening to audio books it is disappointing,positive
646,originally i was going to purchase the kindle paperwhite but i decided to try the kindle fire hdi am a very happy customer with this product i am more able to utilize the most out of prime not only do i get to read books but i can surf the web download apps check email watch videos listen to music etc this may only bebut its perfect for my preference easy to carry around and it even fits in my pockets the size also makes it easy to hold with just one hand while youre readingyou may be asking yourself what about the kindle fireonlyits larger and it even has expandable memory i was a bit bummed when amazon announced the release but im over it gb is good enough memory for me i am able to store more than enough books and media for my liking by the way the kindle fire hdhas a longer battery life faster processor higher screen resolution and better audio support,positive
647,i love this tablet i love being able to have other apps that i use frequently on my phone on a much larger screen its fantastic for downloading childrens games onto to keep my children entertained in the event we have to go out somewhere and it requires them to sit for long periods while being relativity calm downloading things is a snap my only qualm would be with not having access to as many apps as are available on the apple and google play stores but the mainstream apps are mostly all there and of course i love the amount of books i have access to especially up and coming authors that do not have their books in hard print yet fantastic device for the price,positive
648,i will start this off by saying that i am not a fan of the fire tablet at all i am a huge apple fan i got this for my husband however our kids abosutely love to use this tablet its extremely durable and easy to use i love many of the features i didnt even know it had the interface is very easy and clean paired with the price i am truly happy with this purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat,positive
649,some models dont let you add more hard drive spacei screwed that updespite that and the fact that i am a die hard apple lover and the fact that amazon tries way too hard to put me on a sales page whenever possibleand tries to hide the existence of the notamazon universe from mei am totally in love with my kindle hd i went with thebecause it has a higher resolution screena great decision in the future after i buy a fully loaded ipad i will definitely be enthusiastic to purchase a top of the line kindleamazon has created a very enjoyable entertainment focused deviceyou do have to actively explore the web to get outside the amazon experience built into the device but its a great design and easy to work aroundbe sure to dig deep into settingsthere are a lot of them some of which will automatically charge you for stuff double check after system upgrades it reset some things i had turned offi read a dummies guide and realized it would be nice to own a good manual there is a help menu that can be good but every word is geared to the assumption that anything you want shall only be foundand paid forin the amazon universe i shop on amazon a fair amount but do a whole lot of web surfing too and do find a lot of great resources out there its easy to get caught up in the amazon experience which is how the experience is elegantly and enjoyable designed but there is a lot to say for the joy of other worldsi use this device for almost everything i do now and have found some great apps in the app store you cant shop on google play unless you sideloadbut im pretty sure that isnt a good plan unless you know how to program so youd understand the risks and consequencesits a beautiful tabletalso i skipped any screen protector im careful with it but use it all the time and havent put the slightest scratch in the glassits a really fun device,positive
650,i have purchased two earlier kindle fires hd and hdthe fire hdis by far the best fire i have ownedi can not tell you technically how it works but using my wifiit connects to internet very quickly and navigating and refreshing is quick and responsivethe single speaker is much louder than either of the earlier speaker models i have mentionedwatching video both streamed and in memory is flawlessthe brightness can be controlled and the sound is more than adequatereading ebooks in normal light is fine but reading in the sunshine is difficult because of screen glarethe screen size is big enough to read text cruise websites and enjoy videosthe overall size and weight of the hdis perfect for traveling carrying and packing away when necessaryi have had my hdformonth and there are no issuesi highly recommend it if you are looking for the features i have listed in this review,positive
651,the tablet fulfills my basic reason for its purchase that of reading my library of kindle books i like the way it holds a charge i dislike its inability to detect my finger touching the screen sometimes but it generally cooperates with patiencedoc,negative
652,great little tablet battery lasts a lot longer than on myfire charges quickly excellent graphics was concerned about the used label but i cannot find any indications that it has ever been out of the box if you want a small tablet that does almost everything to go with you this is a good answer if you are going to conquer the world then you need a larger one,positive
653,this is so nice i couldnt decide between either a ipod or a ipad because i liked the ipad but i also liked the ipod because it was small and you can get a phone app but the kindleis just in between the size of a ipod and ipad but you cant get a phone app on this but i dont care this is awesome this just small enough to fit in my big pocket but it hurts to bend over so i dont do that anymorei like watching videos on this but before this i used my school kindle and it was horrible for youtubeso to wrap this up this is a decentsized tablet that is great for gaming and videos and internet and i love that all kindles have the amazon prime app on themso i give this thing afor everything this review was done by burger boy,positive

657,dont really like the amazon interphase after having a google nexusfor more thanyrs and using the android software instead but it gets the job done the app store could b better but for the most part ive just relegated to it for the purpose of playing games,positive
658,really great buy for the money but there is seriously no way to prevent your kids from downloading apps that cost money while allowing them to get free ones only buy if only you are using not good for friends family kids etc,neutral
659,not enough space in memory kids are always having me reset their fire then they cry when they lose all their data there should be an easier way to move data and programs to the cloud in fact it should all be on the cloud after amonths the screen broke not very kid tough,negative

663,before you spend the entire day and over an hour on the phone with customer service know thisamazon prime video will not appear on a childs free time profile individual videos will also not appear on childs profile customer service was lovely and helpful but also stymied as to why this happened two reps were working on this problem and still no resolution thoughas it turns out amazon prime video is just not permitted to be on the childs profile dont really understand why the main reason i got this kindle was so that my son could watch dora the explorer and now it can only happen on my adult profile dora is available on free time unlimited but i chose not to get that because it was too many apps and i wanted to limit my sons content there is also a monthly subscription fee for free time unlimited now if my son wants to watch his favorite show his only option is to watch it on my profilemaking the parental controls and user profiles useless there are some other problems but this is the main one for me very unhappy with the fire right now will update if things change,neutral

676,when the expected updated version of the fire hdinchgbinch model didnt materialize this year i was somewhat disappointed as i was going to upgrade my d generation firei figured there would be enough improvements to warrant upgrading what has been a flawless devicei wanted the hd screen so i looked to theinch modeli had an aha moment and thought this would be the perfect size to carry in my purse i thoroughly reviewed the specs so i knew about the one speakeri knew the camera quality wasnt the best but i use my cell phone for thati knew to go with thegb because there is no sd slot to expand memoryi knew any apps i wanted came from amazon no google play shoppingi knew it was somewhat heavy and a bit clunky per some reviewers and possible lag times with the touch screenbut i am ok with that what do you expect for this price rangeforit is a great device and is meeting my expectationsi use it for streaming movies or showsif i dont have my kindle paperwhite handy i can read my booki can check facebook email shop etci am still learning all it does but so far this amazon junkie is loving itoh and it has fireflypoint it at the tv and it will identify the movie let it listen to a few chords of music and it will identify a songi did buy the amazon nonleather cover for it which acts as a stand for viewing movies if i find something i cant live with i will update my reviewupdatei am loving my fire even more since the fire ossoftware updatethe user interface is much better in my opinion and the small little keyboard that everyone complained about is no moreit is very user friendlythis update was automatic i didnt need to do anything other than read the release notes which touch upon some of the new and exciting per amazon featuressome of the changes are just a surprise that you will discover as you move aroundtoday i finally tested the tablet using my cell phone as a hotspotit worked perfectlystill discovering thingsfor those that wonder where the instructions are they are on the devicejust run your finger from the top down to open the menu and hit the help button its a goodat least for me,positive

678,to start things off te kindle has absolutely no good apps what so ever and im saying this coming from an apple product to a kindle which is why im so biased the kindle is good for honestly reading only its the only good feature the gb storage is shot it has no hold what so ever compared to what i had held on my apple product with the same gb storage amount i am very disappointed in the table i did think it contained a google play store at least that it doesnt eiter i think the taplet could be a bit more improvedi think the overall pricing of the tablet is way beyond its means i dont think however its worth the a hundred bucks my take would be to spend on another tablet maybe well worth it because it has no good apps and no good storage u download a couple books and magazines and theis full and it doesnt have the option of adding a memory card for more storage so your pretty much left withgb to basically keep having to delete stuffi think to tablet could have been priced at no more thanbucks and that goes for all of the kindles i think there all over pricedoh and i forgot to mention the speaker the speaker sucks i mean really this tablet is over priced i got mines on a black friday sale and im kinda glad i saced an additionalbucks becausefor this tablet is not worth it folksconsider something else,neutral

682,yes the kindle hdis the best tablet underyes the citron color option is pretty freaking coolhowever a few notesif youre torn between getting the gb and gb storage dont bego with the gb and stop worrying about the slight price increaseyoull thank me latereven if you dont have a kid getting the kids edition may be worth it just for the sake of getting the awesome dropsafe caseoh and the nifty free year of all the kids apps and books is kind of a good idea for me in retrospect since my little one will probably be interested in those things in a few monthsno instagramand a few other android apps are not compatible like the dish network hopper appnot to say you cant modify the os and make this work but it isnt readily availablethe keyboard lagsbadlyits somewhat frustrating at timesthat aside its a nice little tableti was between this and a paperwhite as i was originally on the market for a reader but as some books on amazon are now kindle fire exclusives i opted for thisi dont regret itit will work nicely with my echo once that arrives in a few months and my lo will have a tablet to play with down the road,positive

689,fast shipping good price unit is small without giving the feel of a smart phone a little heavy for its size but very manageable i like the carousel feature to skim through categories and features i did not like that there was no way to upgrade the stored memory like thei purchased for almost the same price,neutral
690,we just gave this to myyear old daughter for her birthday and so far it is great it is a nice size for her it is in between a phone and a tablet size it was very easy to setup and she figured out how to use it in no time it is linked to my amazon account so i can see what apps she is adding and order books etc for her we have two mini ipads also but she really likes her new kindle fire,positive
691,this is my st kindle fire and i couldnt be any happierits so small which is perfect for mei feel sorry for my kindle paperwhite because i probably wont get much use out of it nowi love that i can go from reading to watching a prime movie then checking out pinterest and back to reading all on one tablet,neutral
692,i love it i use it mainly to read and do simple things that i dont need a laptop for i started using it when it was still a carousel and since then has been updated to look more like a tablet its very easy to use and the size is super convenient to just slip into my purse its really the perfect little book,positive
693,bought two of these for myyear old daughters and they are a huge hit love that we can download movies from my prime account and wont need wifi to watch them later say while waiting for a dr appointment or during long car trips i wanted something that they could play games watch movies and use their school tutoring apps on that didnt require a contract like my samsung tablet thru verizonthis was perfect i was torn between the larger screen or the hd and i am glad i chose the hd cuz the pic quality is great especially for twoyear olds will definitely be purchasing one for my sons birthday in september and maybe even one for mommy ive hadkindles and i think they just keep getting better,positive
694,i absolutely love this kindle fire hdi thought i wasnt going to care for the smaller size but honestly i dont mind it a bit netflix and amazon prime videos work greati havent had it buffer at all picture and sound quality is perfect there are so many things that you can do with this kindle that its a neat little device to stash in your bag while going out you dont have to carry a book around since you can store sooo many on here you can check your email social medias search online read ebooks play games and so much more my kids were excited to find out that the roblox app works with the fire hd we have an old kindle fire that it does not work on so if this hdcomes up missing then i know where it is i also love that you can choose your colors instead of the old black color another feature that i noticed is that you can group your ebooks ive done that with some of the ones i am currently reading and saved it to the home screen so its much easier to find oh and amazon music is free for prime members i received this hdfor review purposes but my opinions are strictly my mine and my familys own,positive
695,this is probably just the ticket for someone who loves to read and is on a budget it was way too small for my taste and didnt suit my needs i returned it and got the fire hdwhich was a much better choice for me,positive
696,love the kindle firegreat to watch a movie but not easy to see out doorsthat is the only thing i dont like about the fire is that you cant read outsideyou can read your emails and look up other things on your firebuy books and things like that,positive
697,item received on timeprice was an eyecatcher to buy but worst user interface ever i am on child profiles either i have to add another child profile or be fascinated with lock screen password or set daily goalstime limitsi cannot get past that i tried restarting but it still gets me to that screen and holds me there no way to go back to the first screen or get out of that i cannot begin to say how frustrated i am with this ui how dumb is the ui design that wont let you get out of what you are doing to home page sort of thing some crooked jokers have designed this i will try it out for another few minutesreturn this piece of junk,negative
698,i really like this product you cant beat the price it works really well as an ebook and i like the battery life i got the case with it along with the protection plan good size fits in my pockets of my gym shorts scrubs and jeans i am a man so my pockets may be bigger then in womens clothes,positive
699,do not buy this machineive had to replace it x and on the th replacement i gave up and just took theirrefundthats right they would not refundwhen the kindle never worked properlynow let me tell you about how i used it i used it to repeat one song to put my kids to sleepit only repeated an ocean waveswhite noise songover and over its only taskthree different kindles all ended up frozen on either the amazon screen or the fire screenthey were very kind to send replacementssure they came quickly but they all froze doing the same task even w different song filessave yourself the money and the headache of continually replacing this thingi plan on using myrefund on buying a real white noise machine which i know will not freeze,positive
700,i highly recommend the kindle firehd the only drawback is that it is like every hitech item one buys these days one has to be born knowing how to use these things because there are zero written instructions with them i know you can get help once you are able to get on the tablet but i dont know about everyone else but i wasnt born knowing how to even do that so that being said myyear old granddaughter she was evidently born knowing these things helped me to get to the help section other than that i love it,positive
701,i was surprised and pleased when the contents of my old kindle which i killed by leaving it in the car on a hot day for two hours transferred seamlessly to my new tabletsince it is smaller than my old one i have had to get used to that but otherwise it is great,positive
702,this fire tablet is all that it claims to be with a fewexceptions first of all i find it very slow to respond to touch commands im venturing to guess that the touch screen is not sensitive enough i really have to applysome pressure for it to respondalso it takes several minutes to boot up after being shut down or turned offand lastthe sound quality ismediocre with the volume turned to maximumits still not adequate without headphonesand even with its sizeit still havesome heft to itits not as lite as youdthink,positive
703,the fire hdis perfect size its big enough to read easily while still small enough to comfortably hold in one hand i am learning to love this devicei ordered thedisplay because i have the samsung galaxy note and i am already used to a bigger small screen since i already own atablet i wanted something that was a little smaller and didnt stick out like a sore thumb when in publicthe fire hdis great for readability and privacy its not as easy for people to see what you are reading with a smaller displayone feature i love is that amazon will automatically set it up to sync with your account before they send it to you you also have the option to not have anything synced or set up if giftingi also love that they were available in multiple color choices although i still ended up picking blacki love my galaxy note tablet but i think the kindle fire hdmight have just passed the samsung up with this device very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend to anyone,positive
704,works great and i like all the updated features most recent kindle fire was fromi would have loved to have this version in ainch but its not availablei was looking for a kindle to fit in my purse and this one does hope kindle comes up with a fire hdxinch in the future,positive
705,just right sie for my purse and super fast but i didnt notice that it doesnt have expandable memory so i have to buy another external drive to hold my simsdcards to expand the memory and i cant use that and my headset at same time other than that i love this little thing,positive
706,not as good as expected i guess okay for the price it is slow loading hard copy and pasting wish i could have a different browser also the choices for cases made byvendors are terrible i do enjoy reading books nice to bring a book around in my purse since my ipad air is so large,neutral
707,love this thingi have an iphone and laptop but find myself using this more than either of themits just the right size to sit in bed and watch movies or read and the blue light shut off is genius and works,positive
708,bought in retail store day after it came out was looking some time for tablet to put in suite inner pocket to be durable with good battery life and decent performance finally found this one got a feeling of it at the store and now using it for couple of months as primary personal tablet main usagesnote taking web browsing personal and office emails docs reviewing work literaturereferences storage ebook reading news reading video streaming services found performance battery life and compact size fully suitable for my purposes went forgb since no storage card built in but in combination with usb otg adapter and no issues with different usb drives combined with versatile cloud services found always having at leastfree of available internal space with usage of recommended task managerscleaners did not have issues with size of ram either hdmi output was working also with no issues on several tvs that i tried while in different hotels on my business travels in perspective of the price size decent performance and good battery life more than happy with the purchase,positive
709,star off for heating up wsome apps games also a bit heavier than expected resolution is fabulous could have used stereo sound the user buttons are difficult to findonoff sound perhaps make them colored or raised however worth it for the price points this tablet replaced my fireand im mostly happy with it i do recommend it over the lesser pricedfire,positive
710,i have had the kindle fire hdwifigb for a couple weeks now and i am really impressed with how responsive it is and how vibrant the colors are on the displayi was a bit skeptical about kindle in the beginning because i thought it was just for books imagine my surprisethis version of kindle may be smaller atdisplay however it really is vibrant quick and easy to navigatetakes just a light touch to move around the screen and it responds immediatelythe display of options found at the top make it easy to move around the apps from books music surfing the internet and more i have watched videos read books surf the net and never had a lag timeit is small enough to carry in my purse so it would be perfect for traveling and certainly wont take a lot of roomit comes in a lot of different colors so you can choose the one that is right for you or pick any number of cases there are a lot of options to choose fromyou can choose the screen size fromtoso you decide which is going to fit your needsi was given this product to tryout but this review completely my own experience,positive
711,i really love my new kindle fire hdi bought the gb version as im not so concerned with downloading or storing much other than books i am retired and this is the first tablet i have owned or used as a newbie i found it incredibly easy to set up and start having fun with the only slight downside is that the camera isnt all that greatbut as i bought the fire primarily to replace my old kindle ereader thats not of prime importance to me my kindle cloud books were automatically transferred to my new fire and im enjoying the additional features like author details etc in the ereader the colour and clarity on the screen are both superb and videos are easy and clear to watch the touch screen is extremely responsive and i have experienced none of the glitches reported by earlier reviewers email and facebook are simple to use and the touch keyboard is easy to navigate this is a great entrylevel tablet small and easy to handle or to slip into pocket or bag this little tablet is brilliant value for moneyand it has a lot of heart,neutral
712,low cost kindle fire doing what it is supposed to dodont expect to download a bunch of things since storage is limitedalso there is no way to increase the memory no sd slotif you can live with ascreen and limited memory this unit is for you,negative
713,for the price it is a great product i love the size of this tablet it is a little slower than my fire hdxbut overall it was a great purchase fits nicely in a purse so this will be my tablet for on the go,positive
714,i love my tablet its very clear and a decent size sort of like a large phonefablet sound is good too ive been using it to listen to audiobooks and have watched a couple of movies the battery lasts long also which is probably good for a couple of days,positive
715,i like the kindle fire hdits a great tablet to have if you are always on the goits very convenient to just throw in my purse and keep going with the size being so small if i decide to leave my purse at home i can put it in my pocket i love to read so i can carry my fire hdand read my books in my downtime and with the size being onlyits not taking up much spacethe screen quality is very clear and the speed is very fast i also enjoy having a camera and being able to listen to my music on the goi own another tablet that is a inch screen and since i purchased thisi havent touched my other tableti thought when i bought a tablet for a great price the quality wouldnt be great but i was wrong i am happy with my purchase i also enjoy all the apps that are available i purchased the black gb because i wanted to have more available space i have internet access in the palm of my hands the only thing i dont like is it doesnt have a sd slot to extend memory and i think its a little heavy to be such a small tabletthanks clinetta m,positive
716,ok so i have had many tablets and many phonesi had the first ever kindle that came out and used the amazon ui and it was ok but i decided to root it so i can make it cleaner and faster once my son was born i gave it to him so he can listen to baby music and learn in itso forward two years later that kindle was to slow for him do decided to get him a fire hd ok so the build quality is perfect the size is amazing just for him but the interface is the worst i had ever usedi cant use any google apps and that was the reason i bought ityoutube kidssome games he plays he cant go in go he cant sign into googlei absolutely hate the interface and its not rootable and theres no way to install google apps so if you are looking for a tablet and you need google apps or a simple interface dont buy this please look into another good quality tablet i actually regret not giving him my nexushe doesnt like using it and always wither goes back to my phone or my nexus tabletwaste of money,neutral
717,ive been using a kindle for i believe aroundmonths now at first i liked it just fine aftermonths of use the software is already starting to give out on me there are constantly glitches and issues that are so frustrating that i generally stop using the device i typically only use the device for reading partially because when i try to do anything more than read the glitches are more substantialfor atablet it was not a horrible purchase but you definitely get what you pay for i definitely wished i had not bought this item next time i am in the market for this type of product i will save up and go with something that has more of a technological backbone and can withstand more thanmonths of use,neutral
718,i got this as a gift for my father in law so that he will be able to surf the web as well as read books he just got the hang of his smart phone so i know that the apps on here will be just as easy to use the price was right atand i knew that being able to do more than reading would be what sold him on this tabletthe fire is well built and does not feel cheap the size a little larger than a paperback of this is great because the screen is bigger than his smart phone but not too big or heavy for him to tote into the woods while he is camping thehour battery life is also something that lead me to purchasing this itemthe front and rear camera will come in very handy as he has a new grandbaby that he will be able to skype with and the speaker on this provides enough sound to hear the picture quality is amazing and the colors pop i also like that i can connect this with my amazon prime so we can watch movies on it,positive
719,i was a little disappointed with this product but not too surprised considering the price the battery doesnt last that long and it randomly reboots itself but if youre looking for a cheap ereader this isnt a bad choice i just wouldnt recommend it for much else,negative
720,love the kindle but be warned the special offers are super annoying i ended up spending the extrabucks to get rid of them the tablet itselfworks great and is definitely a great buy very low price for what you get,neutral
721,excellent productdont get seven inch and the ipad mini and the samsung galaxy tablet and any other tablet this is perfect fits in hand and pocketfunctions just like an ipad just it is fatter but that is fine and much cheaper,positive
722,i received this kindle in exchange for my honest unbiased review prior to receiving this kindle i had one of the first kindles which is still going strong the first thing i noticed when powering it on was how much clearer the pictures is the clarity and hd is a major plus while watching netflix or amazon instant video its very simple to use and navigate through the options registering of course any one can handle and use all the apps availablei choose the color white for mine and it really is sleek and stylish its the perfect size to be carried around in my purse with me another nice part about this kindle is it has a camera unlike the older model the touch screen is also very responsive no lagging or stallingthe price that these are offered for i would purchase one for my oldest as they really have so many options and being able to select colors and have access to so many different applications make it a great option,positive
723,love love love my kindle i mostly use it for reading i havent really bought an actual book since but its so much more its linked to my wifi at home so i can use it like a phone or computer social media playing games etc easy to use reliable long battery life,positive
724,prior to purchasing the kindle fire hdi owned an older model of the kindle fire what i first noticed is that the screen is far smaller than what im used to with that being said i absolutely love the small size as it is practical easy to carry around and much easier to handle i found the reading experience to be far more comfortable than that of its larger counterpartwhat i loved the most about the kindle is the goodreads integration im an avid reader and have only recently started using goodreads regularly so its become somewhat of an obsession for meon the other hand i must say that i noticed the kindle was slow at times the speakers leave much to be desired and there have also been moments when my kindle just starts to make weird sounds i thought that was odd but turned down the volume and let it sit for a bit and the sound had stopped i never did figure out what it wasid recommend this to those of you looking for a lowcost ereader its not an ipad nor is it a samsung but the reading experience cant be beat,positive
725,its alright i like it does what its supposed to do and it is a bit slow at times once i got it and connected it to my wifi at home it updated it a lot it has changed drastically since i got it from the updates alone,negative
726,i really like mine with that being said i am a woman it is smaller than thewhich is fine for me mydaughters have ain and they love it my husband thought it was a little small for him but he is got the largest phone tv tablet ect he said he would be happy with thescreen i love mine it fits in my purse fits my hands and is just right for me it replaced my kindle ereader keyboard which i loved but both of mine broke with in a year with very light use this one feels better than those did it has a button instead of a slide on switch i have had no issues and dont expect to either i mainly use it to read but im also using it to shop and watch a few things while we are on the road all in all i love mine it is a hit on all fronts for me if you are shopping for a man with larger hands it might be a little small it is light enough for carrying around and using everywhere i have never had an i pad but my moms is heavy and i would take my kindle fire over her i pad anyday personally i dont feel you can beat the price for what you get and i havent found anything i cant do on it yet i have had it a month so far and i have no complaints yet,neutral
727,love love love it i cant say anything bad about it it is a very nice upgrade from the basic kindle but it is not a full tablet it is a very nice combination of both i would and will recommend to othersincluding my kids and grandkids,positive
728,this product was bundled with rosetta stone but it does not work with bundled software the software only works on a computer also the fire says poor wifi signal every other device has strong signal the router isfeet away there is no reason to recieve a poor signalvery disappointed in amazon for this product and for bundling it with software that can not be activated on the hardwarevery disappointing consumer experience ive spent a lot of money on amazon and i will think twice before ordering again total garbage can not use itrosetta stone says you can activate for a couple months on mobile device after you download software on pc i dont want the product on a pc i wanted it on the bundled fire why are these incompatible items bundled togetherof course they will probably charge you monthly if you forget to cancel,neutral
729,this tablet fits the size i was looking for to use while traveling i have the fire hdx which i just used as my main tablet during a recentday trip the ability of having one tablet with access to all your amazon music books and videos is just great while on the road i also took my ipad and mini ipad but found myself using the fire hdxalmost exclusively before we go any farther remember this tablet is onlyfor that price point this little guy packs a wallop compare the specs to some of the more expensive tablets and you will quickly see why i am glad it doesnt have access to google play store i have a galaxy notethat is so overrun by google apps that it is almost unusable if you are likeof the people that just want a good tablet to surf the web read email and listen to some music or watch a video this is a good choice in response to some of the reviewers that say it is too small remember the box indicated it is ainch tablet however that is what really made this a great purchase for me very easy to use with one hand the ability to stick this thing in my pocket and walk around with everything is just great give this tablet a try and you wont be disappointed thanks amazon for another great product,neutral
730,bought one of these for myyear old he loved it so much i had to get one for my daughter too just to stop the fighting over it shes these things are awesome they are not top of the line specd devices but they play anything my kids will throw at it so long as theres a wifi signal nearby youre set the parental controls are a snap and i feel better knowing the kids are protected from doing things they shouldnt be doing on them make sure you buy a case for this itll make it bulkier but spending a few dollars to ensure it doesnt break when its dropped is common sense in my book they have held up perfectly so far i intend to have a replacement on order the day one of them finally breaks thank you amazon,positive
731,absolutely what i was looking fori read constantly being of retirement age i can no longer afford to buybooks weeklyi can however affordper month to read unlimited downloads from kindle unlimitednuff said,positive
732,i bought this for my yearold auntthat had lost her husband and was lonelyanddidnt have much of a social life she lives in new york i live in oregon best thing i ever did was buy this for her she will tell you its the best gift shes ever had she is socially connected nowthe only problem whatsoever was i bought it as a gift sent it to her and before i went back to new york for four months she had all my information all my pictures as if it was my second kindle,positive
733,i bought one for my housemate for her birthday and was so impressed that i bought myself one not long after great tablet for the price and it really saves my phone battery since i use the kindle fire for entertainment nowpros perfect size its small enough for my very mostly sized purse but offers a large screen than my phone its right and the size of a paperback book making it easy to hold with one hand nice display the picture quality is clear and detailed price onlywhen i purchased the itemcons amazon app store its not that i dont like the amazon app store but i have a lot of apps on the google play store that i dont want to have to purchase again sometimes when im reading my fingertips will press into the side just enough to turn the page accidentally,positive
734,have had it for a while when i try to use apps like dishanywhere to watch live tv or for it crashes when i try to play games on it it crashes repeatedly endlessly so frustrating and the funny thing is that when i use the same apps on my iphone s theres no problem ive called and gone through all types of steps to get the apps to work but they still crash after running for a few moments i have come to the conclusion that it is just inferior technology so here i am squinting watching a shown on my tiny iphonescreen while my kindle sits there useless mocking me its only good for reading books dont let them fool you,negative
735,i bought this device to be a semireplacement for a laptop i assumed to used bluetooth keyboard and mouse and otherwise would have access to apps email and web with that in mind a few complaintsthe main carousel feature has to be one of the worst ux items i have ever seen on any other device i use i have a clean desktop and folders organized neatly to find things the carousel is monstrously huge icons which you have no control over and which you would have to swipe through the random sorting to find what you need baddropbox and google drive so far have been quite difficult to download again with other devices i use its a pretty easy process to either download an app or go directly to the website to use google play which requires its own app which i cannot find which you need to activate online downloadsim sure it will make more sense in time but its really backwards right nowall for now,neutral
736,difficult to get a book and read print way two small on the screenadsservices i dont have a finger small enought to order anythingthis was birthday gift for wife she has yet to turn it on or use it waste of money,negative
737,i still own use daily and adore my first kindle with keyboard even though it still works great i wanted something that i could watch netflix amazon prime play games and see magazines in color plus read books all in one handy device enter the kindle hdfor my personal needs this nifty gadget does it all i have theversion with ads andgb storage the ads do not bother me a bitand the gb is sufficient for my needs i have been using it for a month now as i wanted to spend time to using it before reviewingthis device is a boon to anyone with amazon prime the amount of prime content in videos musicgames and apps keeps me busy and entertainedkindle unlimited for books is another pleasure and theextra fee for the unlimited books more than pays for itself i have had extremely smooth streaming of videos and gameplay is also smooth and easy for the games i playi have no complaints and think that for the price it is beyond amazingps although trivial i was tickled that the product has color choices mine is pink and the color makes me smile so much more than boring black,neutral
738,i love love this little tablet its small enough to take with me but bigger then my smartphone so it makes it nicer to watch netflix and prime on its pretty fast it has some slow moments but so does my phone so no biggie it isnt to bad on weight to me and i just love everything about it i got the case in the same color so it can stand will i watch stuff i also use it for facebook and web browsing and i must say i expected the silk browser to be a headache but to my surprise it works pretty fast i think its all about connection which might be why some have a issue with it i went back on forth on wanting this and not because of the bad reviews but i am happy i took the risk to get it because the colors are vibrant and everything i got thegb and i am not even close to filling it the camera isnt great but its not terrible either but i would say use your phone camera instead oh the app store doesnt have a ton of apps but enough of what i use to keep me happy i also like that i can download movies to the tablet for when i dont have wifi for free with my prime membership okay think thats all hope its helpful bridget,neutral
739,android apps dont work properlycant organize anything except by apps books etcconsidering this isa kindle books should be sorted correctly under the author optionnopei didnt watch any videos so i cant comment on thatif i can return it i will,positive

741,resolution is pretty good but download speed and processing speed is terrible this could only connect to ghz networks not ghz networks well was hoping for a valueformoney but instead got a yougetwhatyoupaidfor,positive
742,im glad i didnt get a larger tablet the fire hd is the perfect size for my needsjust a bit larger than my mobile phone yet large and sharp enough for reading as for mobile games the ones that i play are truly meant for a phone on larger tablets especially at thesize the graphics tend to look a bit muddy not so with the hd its just enough of a step up to give me the visual and physical real estate i want and need for gaming videos look great but i do wish that it had a frontfacing speaker i wont pull a star for this though since this model was designed almost two years ago for everything that this very portable little tablet has in terms of hardware it is hands down the best one you can buy at this price well deserved five stars,positive
743,the only reason we got a kindle instead of the ipad was because of the commercial on the website showing the actual drop test and one falling off the top of a minivan to the pavement they advertise that it is x as durable as an ipad i accidentally dropped itfeet from a sitting position onto the carpet and it stopped working since it is still under the warranty period i called to get it repaired i explained the situation and they told me that since it was dropped it voided the warranty i emphasized the claims they make about the drop test and that it was droppedfeet unto carpet not the hard surfaces they show in their advertisement and they said there was nothing i could do about it that is false advertising i have an ipad that survived a major accident the metal case even was dented due to impact and a year later it is still working do not believe their claim if you drop it no matter if it is dropping it on your bed they will void the warranty and you are stuck having to buy a new one i am happy to give more details if you would like before making the purchase just write the question on the comment section of the review and i will be happy to respond this was on a fire hd,neutral
744,this is the perfect size tablet for meanything bigger and its too much to handlethe interface is intuitive and its pretty easy to usemy son mostly uses it and he loves it alsobut i am not crazy about the kids mode in his profileits easier for him to just use my profilei also have a samsung tab eand it is just too big and difficult to hold my firei love it,positive
745,im used to samsung products so this is all new yet familiar because its a tablet i honestly havent put it down since it arrived i love it the picture is nice and clear its fast the battery doesnt drop fast the only complaint i have is sometimes it takes a little while to load things fully im used to that my old tablet took forever at times,positive
746,i purchasedone for each of my younger childeni love love love this table becuase it allows you to go from reading books to playing games to watching online videos and so much more without missing a breatmyyear old has dropped his table more time than i can count it is still working just like it did on day onei love that with this table i have access to every app he usesi have not noticed any slowing down like with my other tablei love this table so much that i ended up getting myself one and now thinking about getting a bigger one,positive
747,its small light has good screen resolution whats not to like battery life is a bit less than i expected but nothing is perfect i can certainly recommend the hdfor anyone looking for a small versatile tablet or a replacement for an earlier kindle reader,positive
748,my th amazon peripheral and i am still very pleased ordered it for the fact that i wanted a smaller tablet to use when i want really lounge fast processor and very sturdy ive owned an ipad mini and different android tabs and even a surfacei keep finding myself going for the kindle fires for the simplicity and very quality for the ppi for the price you just cant beat it and definitely leagues above any china nonbranded in the same price range and not buggy at allyou dont have to dropfor a quality tablet when fire is where its at,positive
749,i had spoken to the help people twice and they were very nice but they never mentioned it could be a battery problem that was the problem and once i had it replaced my hdworked fine i called amazon just to say that you could tell people it could be a battery problem instead of telling me i need a new kindle they did not seem happy that i called about that they said i could send my new kindle back but i had already loaded all my info into it and it has some upgraded features that i really like,positive
750,the bad first i do not like that fact i cannot add memory storage on my own if i am not near wifi i cannot access any cloud content i would prefer to add a microsd card if i want to i got the gb and it is not enough memory because from the point of first turning it on i only hadgb memory i can usethe weight of this tablet is bulky and a little heavy for the sizethe good i love how portable this tablet is the screen size takes some getting used to but i love how bright it is the screen is very responsive i have never used the kindle fire os and i like it took a little bit of time to find all things in menus and discover where certain settings are but was easy enough to navigate through it in portrait mode the internet was a little difficult to view but better in landscape mode in that case the larger tablet would be better however cannot beat the price for a tablet you can do most on like other comparable tablets out there,positive
751,good for the price i bought it for work because i wanted a camera vpn and work email supportthe camera is ok but basic given what smart phone cameras can do today i expected more here could not figure out the built in vpn and just installed cisco anytime connect which i use on everything else and it works fine the built in email app supports imap so setting up work mail was easy and the mail app does a good job on formatting but is lite on securityother then that everything runs smooth just like on other kindles and atab with no monthly fees or data caps that can be used in a corporate environment is pretty darn goodtwo side notesi got the gb version which only has gb of useable space not sure what you would get with the gbi got the origami case designed just for this kindle nice case butwhen you open it it covers the camera you have to hold the cover up when using the camera what a pain and if you turn it upside down so the cover hangs down where you intuitively hold it your fingers get in the way i see this as a pretty dumb design miss,neutral
752,i thought i had already reviewed this item i was probably confusing it with the base i also bought for it great this is exactly what i need and will be excellent for me once i have mastered how to use it i have been wanting something i could use when im waiting in the hospital in a drs office etc which at my advanced age i seem to be doing a lot this makes me feel easily attched to my home desktop computer reading email etc,neutral
753,the os works well there are a lot of great apps available the price is fantastic but the trade off is the special offers which are nothing more than advertisements that are constantly thrown at you the affordability outweighs the annoyance of the ads however great valueit took me a while to respond to a criticism of my original review one person pointed out that advertisements are not constantly thrown at you i must admit that it was poorly stated on my partto clarify each time you activate the device there will be an advertisement on the lock screen i would prefer the ability to customize the screen but i imagine the ads help keep the price of the device belowspecial offers from amazon will appear as notifications from time to time they could probably be ignored by most people i personally like to check them out although i have not yet purchased any of them what i find to be most annoying is the occasional offer from apps ive deleted i deleted it with purpose i dont want to be beckoned back with unsubstantial discountsagain its a really good device with the lowest cost so the value is very high,positive
754,im an apple user so this took me a while to understand this and then teach it to my son once i did he caught on quickly he wasand has really taken it over he now shows me how to do thing on here its perfect for my toddlerlittle guy we havepurchased during the first prime day great deal and not too overwhuto replace if lost or damaged the amazon kids subscription is really awesome to go with it by far the greatest selection and the most cost effective option,positive
755,i was disappointed when my fire hdquit working after justmonthsi contacted kndle customr service they were unable to help me so i decided to buy the new fire hdi have only had it for about two weeks but i am enoying itit is smaller tha the original fire hdwhich makes it easier to handle and fit into pockets for conveniencei purchased the gb version and now wish i had spent the extra to get gbnever the less for how i use it it suits me fine,neutral
756,i like it in that its much faster than my old one the battery doesnt hold a charge very long i was also hoping id be able to use it outside but no lucktoo much reflection i sure wish one of the tablets will eventually have a screen like the ereaders,positive
757,love this tableti prefer the fire because i can do almost everything on it that i can do with a ipadi can play games and read my emaili especially likereading books on itit fits in my purse and i take it with me every dayit also takes picturesi would definitely recommend it,positive
758,this is a great gadget for an incredibly affordable price no it’s not as amazing as an ipad but for such a good price it performs practically all the same functions from listening to music reading books watching films and morei ended up getting one for my girlfriend for her birthday as well and she absolutely loves it battery life is very good and it’s the perfect size and very light i think the only thing that can make this device even better is more availability of apps amazon is still lacking in the app development department but i am confident they will catch up as demand for this item will continue to grow i highly recommend getting a cheap case for it which also functions as a stand,positive
759,this works great if you want a color ereader to watch netflix in bed or something larger than a phone to surf the web on or play an occasional game however its a bit hampered by its os its using a striped down version of android so certain apps available in the normal google play store arent available on the fire for example youre forced to use amazons web browser silk which is very basic if youre looking for a basic entry level tablet or a color ereader it works great for anything else id look elsewhere,positive
760,i use it for reading ebooks searching the internet and checking emails i can hardly believe how handy it is especially when considering how inexpensive it was my guess is that jeff bezos is a genius who has other geniuses working for him,positive
761,i unfortunately bought two and this tablet is only good for reading books amazon prime video internet and crappy app selectionthe app selection is so poor it explains why the amazon phone failed miserablyi have even gone so far as to side load all of the google services apps in an attempt to sideload google play appsmost dont fully work with the latest kindle fireswhen i bought these tablets the description said they had a micro hdmi port it even said that a week after i bought themturns out they removed the port and eventually updated the descriptionif there was a way to root them and install android i would do thatbut since there is not a way to do that currently the two kindle fires i bought will be up on ebay for a loss soonif you read books watch only amazon prime and surf the internet it seems solid enoughbut no real tablet use beyond that in my opinionhitting submit feeling i gave the tablets one to many stars,neutral
762,i really love this little reader so small and easy tocarry in my purse just what i hoped for so yes this customer is very pleased thank you amazon,positive
763,its atablet has many bugs most annoying is turning off addsand yep sure enoughits there still bought as an experiment glad i didnt buy fire phone pros its a good off reader cons are the bugs in the system it will be ok if i can install a normal android on it wouldnt recommend to anyone,positive

766,i loved my kindle fire nd generation i would have kept it if it had a larger capacity than gb i like my kindle fire hdwhich has gb how i wish the kindle tablets had external storage so that if i should run out of storage capacity i wont need to purchase a larger device i understand the cloud concept and accept it greatly i love thesize its perfect for my purse and handling i love having the ability to create spreadsheets and documents directly on the device this is a real nice perk i havent tested the ability to watch movies i use the kindle mainly to read play games and listen to music the kindle tablet will be a long term friend unless something else takes it place i have had several problems with the touch to launch items ive had to hit the icons multiple times before it launches overall its a great device and i havent discovered another to replace it,neutral
767,i have two kindle fire hds now the slightly older hd and now the newer hd while i like the kindle fire hdthere is one major issue i have with amazon they need to update the os to the latest version before shipping i live in an area where we are forced to pay per gb of data no cable or other wired access to the internet was run down our street so our street only has internet access via cellular data plans to get a new system with an older os xx that needs to go throughsets of upgrades just to get to osand then still hasnt updated all the way to the currentis ridiculous even more the initial os xx intro and layout are different enough to be confusing when upgraded to os xx come on amazon you are better than this,negative
768,i love my fire its a wonderful additiion for my online devicesi let my daughter get on to watch all the latest movieswe loved iti can paste or type a document on here just like my laptopwow,neutral
769,love my fire hdhavent had as much time to use it because of the holidays but for the time that i have i am very satisfied once things calm down i can set up my amazon prime on my tvs and fire hdvery good buy,positive
770,i love my kindle fire hdthe battery time is great i play music for hours while i do other things on the tablet and the battery goes down very little i was able to put all my desired apps on it i can read my book in bed on my old kindle then pick up and continue reading the next day on my new kindle fire the only reason i only gave itstars is because my first kindle fire hdstopped working after only a couple of days and i had to return it for a new one this one works great tho i havent had any problems and it walks you thru things you want to do on it,neutral
771,two simple wordslove it i bought it mostly for ebooks and audio books and the higher screen resolution is great for the books ive read for hours without eye strain all the other bells and whistles available thru the apps can make it hard to manage reading time as the videos and games are compelling,neutral
772,this is literally the worst peice of technology i have ever used i was having so many problems with it that i returned it for another replacement the replacement had the same problems battery drains while not using the device device constantly freezes or glitches with the only way to fix it being a hard restart interface operating system is not intuitive just trying to find amazon video left me swearing in frustrationhonestly ive never had a peice of technology that i wanted to smash because it left me so frustrated until this one i would never recommend this to anyone,negative
773,impulse purchase its ok if all you want to do is watch amazon video great picture read kindle books or check your facebookother than that i wish i would have purchased a full functioning tabletill sell you this one for,positive
774,this isnt a review on the product the kindle fire worked great my beef is with the claims on the commercial that the fire can fall off the roof of a minivan and still work perfectly i bought this fire for my daughter for christmas we didnt purchase the extended warranty because we thought we were buying a reliable product one day my daughter dropped her fire from about three feet shes five feet tall so i am estimating and the screen shattered when i called amazon they said that there was nothing they could do i had no choice but to purchase her another fire along with the case and the extended warranty now i see on the commercials how you can essentially throw the fire out the window and it wont break i am truly disappointed by this and now im stuck with a fire with a broken screen and a working fire for which i essentially paid,neutral
775,great tablet and the perfect size and it packs some good specs for atablet i highly recommend this tableta year later i bought another one for me on sale and i thought i give it another review and its still holds up spec wise and now theres a method to add the google play store without rooting your device and its best of both worlds hands down its my tab i take on the go its the perfect size to fit in most pockets and the chip hasnt got a upgrade but it didnt need to its still snappy with no lag in the ui and most games plays smooth as butter so there you have it its not the world most advanced tablet but for it it is it gets the job done and for price its a steal,positive
776,purchasedfire hd for work to use at our annual fundraising to collect donations using the paypal here appworked wonderfullyyou do have to download the apk as paypal here is not available in the amazon app storegreat size for our needs fits nicely in one hand the screen resolution is superb saved us having to rent ipads and basically they paid for themselves this first year,positive
777,i couldnt justify the cost for an ipad mini so after seeing my grandsons fire hdi decided to get thegb version and have not been disappointed the display is beautiful the response speed is adequate the battery life easily meets my needs and there is a good selection of appsthe camera is not superb but it works although i use other devices for pictures its thicker and weighs more than an ipad mini but not so much that its a problem for me also i dont find the ads to be annoying all and all im very pleased,neutral
778,good display very clear but i only use for readingsolitare probably didnt need all that it has on it but would be great for someone who uses all the programs the camera isnt as good as i thought it would be,positive
779,bought this in augustfor our thenyear oldpaired it with this caseamazon freetime kidproof case for fire hdbluebeing ainch tablet it fits his hands better than myinch so he holds on to it betterbattery life is decentas my son is constantly off and on its hard to determine exactly how long it lasts but generally most of the dayonce again thats with off an on usei have him as a child under my account so its easy to control what he has access toi believe there is a newer version of this out but with the prices of thebeing cheaper im not sure id buy anotherinchi would however definitely recommend a fire tablet,neutral
780,awesome kindle i have a larger one as well but this one fits perfectly in my purse i find i use this one almost all the time amazon has a wonderful help line for all purchases and i have taken advantage of that service many times theres been no need for help in using this best ever yet kindlethere seems to be no end to the free books kindle makes available and the ones i buy are reasonably priced i pay a yearly fee for prime membership and the savings alone for free shipping has more than paid my feeviola dougherty author of the man behind the cardboard sign,positive
781,good using bluetooth with headphones for books using with amazons full size bluetooth speaker for music ok for reading but heavier than the kindle reader i normally use my amazonor inch tablets for reading,positive
782,i dont usually take the time to write a review but after rereading all the posted reviews i felt i had to respond i received my new fire hdand was so excited because of the size and the fabulous reviews well after fully charging i was excited to get going and start using it the screen is so unresponsive i was frustrated in a few minutes i put it away and later turned it on and made sure i had a good wireless connection and tried again surprise it still was very hard to operate i went to all the help areas and got no help i looked for the screen sensitivity switch and i couldnt find it more frustration at this point i put it away and dug out my other kindle fire and will probably return thei am open to suggestions but i will probably will return it,positive
783,good sturdy product for my son however i noticed processor speed is a little slow he is young so it doesnt matter for him but when i use it i notice an occasional long load time or delay in touch commands the system is very kid userfriendly and it is perfect for what we bought it for which is for use of ayear old boy great product especially for the price just wish thewas available when i went to purchase i got theyear warranty with it and feel very confident about letting my son use and handle it independently i love that the warranty is for all accidents dropping or water damage etc and i can getreplacements within the time frameno questions asked very happy with our purchase,positive
784,i am still trying to figure it all outespecially with the new updateit seems to work greatright now i mostly use it for games but i am slowly figuring how to use it morethe picture quality is great,neutral
785,why i like this product is that you can buy stuff with amazon just with one click and the kindle is for a great price you can play games read and watch movies this tablet is good for kids because you can buy a case for kids and there are a lot of kidfriendly opportunities out thereok so here is where i get into the real storyi dropped my kindle fire hd in water you think it would be a goner right but then my dad found out that he could reset it and it worked from that point on hope you buy it you will like it by the way i am nine years old by the way i would get the protection plan,positive
786,disappointed my first kindle fireended up with a cracked screen within weeksamazon could do nothing to help except tell me to buy a new one no repair service offered the second one ive purchased has a problem with the volume that ive had no luck fixing when using the netflix app with headphones the volume randomly drops to mute the volume bar annoying stays on the screen and wont allow it to be turned back up either through settings or the volume buttons hard reset is the only suggested fix and it just does the same thing once started up again very disappointed,neutral

788,got this for myyear old son who likes to play with his fathers ipad we thought with the parental controls and ability to be educational as well as fun it was a good fit he loves it and i dont worry about him stumbling upon inappropriate material hes able to play his favorite games watch age appropriate videos read books and he loves to make his own videos and take pictures it was a great choice for us and we didnt pay a small fortune for itthe only thing that is a little confusing is that its linked to my amazon account and i had to make him his own profile but to manage content i have to be on my profile where i can view my books from my own kindle which he doesnt need to see but once we figured out how to go back and forth from the profile it isnt so bad plus it allows me to make the purchases instead of him,neutral
789,best tablet you can buy at the priceespecially if you catch it on salescreen is fairly sharp good for netflix and hbo go the sound is well mediocre would probably be a complimentif youre going to watch a tv show or crank your spotify id suggest headphones or a bluetooth speaker the cameras that are included are complete garbage but i expected as much it seems as if the os is still set up for a larger probably seven inch screen that sometimes can be bothersome the form factor of the unit is perfect for mei have pretty small hands for a man and it is very comfortable to hold and flip pages with just one handthe tablet moves at a pretty quick paceive downloaded a couple of games and they chug along just fine without any hiccupsas far as reading on the tablet it has been a complete pleasurei love the goodreads integrationthumbs up from me amazon,neutral

792,horrible battery life horrible had i known the battery life was so bad i would have chosen differently i had an original kindle and absolutely loved it the only reason i upgraded was because my daughter borrowed my kindle to read a book and forgot she left it on the floor and ended up stepping on it which broke the screen and amazon no longer made those anymore i received this as a gift to replace the broken kindle,negative

799,my young son is using this kindle fire hdfor reading and the apps for some of his favorite games he was happy to find star wars lego and minecraft available some of the apps do require a wifi connection so they dont work when we are travelingthough the battery drains fast with additional wifi and app usage compared to my kindle reader which only needs charging once a month it also charges very quicklyi chose the gb version because i wanted the extra storage for photoswe are still discovering more and more capabilities it is much more complex than our previous kindle readeri received this product in exchange for an honest review,positive
800,have never had a kindle before or read an ebook kind of old fashioned but this fire hdfar exceeded my expectations it has a sharp clear picture for viewing netflix videos while i work out on the elliptical machine likewise the ebook is easy to read turn pagesand even highlight passages this device will never replace a real book or a wide screen hd television but its an excellent complement id recommend the fire hdto anyone whod like an easily transportable tablet,positive
801,i bought this item for myyear old for christmas it works just like my larger kindle fire hd but at a better size for her to handle it comes with great parental controls which are a necessity for her she has ordered movies with the one click option on my kindle the controls make it so she cant buy anything or access the internet without my code lots of free educational apps available through amazon well worth the price,positive

805,unbelievable tablet for the price im so picky and demanding of my electronics and this performs better in nearly every way than the ipad mini its replacing the size is a big selling point too as the main user needs some portability but wants something bigger than a typical smartphone its fast its intuitive and the display is amazing this should be in your cart now,neutral
806,has potential what it does wrong is when i press one part of the screen other parts get pushed occasionally this is bad for games and when typing hard resetting and factory resetting didnt work the os is also a bloatware bogged down android system the amazon app market is also very limited next to google play market and apple most importantly there is no clash of clansi just got itdays ago and bestbuy almost wouldnt let me exchange it for another more reliable brand doesnt come close to my rooted nook hd anyways i ended up switching it for a samsung tab,negative

810,bought two at the same time but one of them is well taken care of and one of them is owned by me capt dropsy and has hit my hardwood or tile floors well overtimes and shows absolutely no signs of damage whatsoevermine is a replacement because right after i bought the first one it developed a weird pixelation burnout situation that seems like just one of those fluke things compared to how well the other two are holding upwhile they are highly durable without any case at all still i highly recommend the leather or faux leather cases that amazon sells for these because not only is it a bit added protection if it does fall but without a case these things slide right out of my hands or off tables very easily,positive

814,im an apple user so buying this kindle fire hdtook me a while to get used to the android style for doing things basic this tablet is actually nice for the price you can surf online do some reading watch videos play games you can even do some homework in here too if you use ebooks for class i got this in black it actually looks expensive and the amazon label isnt as showy on the back all i need now is find a good case for this and im all set,neutral
815,had i done more research i would not have purchased this tablet the tablet itself is great for the price the amazon appstore makes this tablet almost unusable the amazon appstore has a horrible selection of apps google play apps are not able to be used on this tablet if you want a tablet to only read kindle books and shop on amazon this is the one for you,positive

817,got these for our kids for christmas agesand they both love them these are great for kids because they are built tough my kids have dropped them too many times to count and the screens still look perfect and they work perfect the thing i love most is the parental controls and i love that everytime an app is purchaseddownloaded it sends me an email because they are linked to my amazon account i also really love that i can be on my phonecomputertablet and shop for apps and games for them on my device and add them to their fire without even having to touch the fire at all best electronic device we have purchased for our kids,neutral
818,ok so this rating is specifically the result of a policy in which amazon restricts video for child accounts you cant have amazonprime instant video netflix hulu plus and probably any streaming service this is simply because amazon wants prime members to also pay for freetime come on amazon treat your customers right you should change freetime to freelunch because all you want is prime members to pay more and more and more if i want freetime i will pay for itbut let me use the primevideo that i already pay for shame on you amazon,neutral

825,whilethe speed is fine this clearily built on open source software yet they lock it down with bootloader and in the software removing thing that alot of software need to run and forget about trying yo upgrade programs from another source your screwed with out going threw sideloading i have found a lot of the very common software it out of the date on amazon i would not buy again unless they release the software open source as required with a gpl license and they give a option to unlock the boot loader even if have to pay a little extra years from now this thing be a paper weight when i could turn into another function piece of hardware such as load ubuntu on it and turn it into a server,neutral
826,clunky ui although fireosameliorated some of the issuesafter a year of mild bedside usage only just after warranty expired screen developed lines which progressively got worse till completely uselessmyyear asus transformer is still going strongps its cheap so maybe has to break down,negative
827,it started off nice and smooth i got my tablet in the summer and really only started using it when i went back to school for my online classes and now it says that wifi is available but yet it will not connect to any of them ive restarted it and i even rebooted the whole thing but its just not working and i never dropped it we have two other kindles in the family and they both work well so i thought this would work but no such luck it is just really inconvenient since i really needed it for school,positive
828,i bought this for myyr old son for his birthday and he loves it we previously had a nabi for him and he had limited availability of apps the kindle has all the apps that a phone has and more only thing i did not realize is that the books on my other kindle account would load to his kindle due to the same account being used to purchase it this was fixed by creating separate accounts for him and setting the parental controls on it which was very easy i defiantly like the parental controls like the fact that the parent has to be logged in to purchase any games or buy any products i think this tablet is very size appropriate for a child and does exactly what i need it to sound is good quality,neutral
829,pretty pleased with this all of the updates install seamlessly and made the fire even easier to use the only thing i dint life is it isnt super intuitive to find nonamazon items its easy to find any digital item sold by anazon but its trickier to find downloaded pdfs for example,positive

833,this is my nd fire hdtablet purchase and i continue to be impressed with the reliable and speedy function of this little tableti purchased the fire hdtablet earlier in the year and was very disappointed in the performanceit is slow and glitchy while the fire hdperforms smoothly and efficientlymy dream tablet would a fire hdthat runs like a fire hdi have had previous versions of the fire tablets but this one has been the best performer for the priceit is a bit small but does the job,neutral

836,perfect size durability and price for ayear olds tablethe loves the games he can add from amazonthey keep him busy and off of my phone the only downfall is the lack of external storage for videos,negative
837,perfect for use as a second kindlethe small footprint is great for travellingit has all the functionality of the largest model which i also have plus the convenience of extreme portability when i leave the housei can stick it in my back jeans pocket or my sport coat vest pocketand you cant beat the price well done amazon,neutral
838,i absolutely love my kindle fire hdive had more enjoyment with this device as far as it does everything whether i want to read play games goof off on social media it just covers everything i want to do i received my fire in a drawing from one of my favorite authors bobby adair if your a reader and you like apocalyptic reading material i highly recommend him anyway as far as figuring my fire out i just looked at the basic info that came in the package with my device and i was able to sit down and figure it out without any drawn out tutorials pretty quickly its that easy to use i will go back and check those out to see if i missed any other features though one of the best gifts ive ever received love love love it,positive
839,compared to my previous fire nd generationthis is not nearly as gooddifficult to get back to the home pagenot as responsive and frankly i am sorry that amazon has gone to this tablet formati do not play gamesuse social media etc and would prefer the option of a simpler version like my older model which unfortunately died,neutral
840,this is amazing beautiful color display easy to use and stays charged for months if you dont use iti bought this as a backup to my laptopmy laptop broke down and i was worried i didnt have enough battery storage on my fire surprisingly after not using it for a few months it hadleftafter that i now carry it with me in my manbag fits perfectlyget a nice case for it you wont be disappointed,neutral
841,this is the second time ive purchased a cover for a kindle fire hdthis one was a gift i love my pink cover so much when i bought a kindle as a gift i went right to these covers and got one in green and the receiver loves it as well my cover is over a year old it is used daily and stands up to rough handling shoving in a purse and opening and closing a dozen times one of the best purchases ive made in yearsas an aside i love this company i told them i no longer had the penstylus that comes with the cover and they sent me a replacement i highly recommend them and have and would buy from them again,positive
842,i really like this tablet i have a second generation ipad and this is much faster even though its much smaller i still like it love the blue shade feature i wont bother with another ipad and will stick to kindle fires going forward,neutral
843,for those of you trying to decide between the fire hdvs fire hdthis may helpall i cared about between the two was the screen clarity and the sound clarity and volumeregarding the difference in the screen clarity there is just a hairs advantage to thenot much in it at all though the extra pixels per square inch make the hdjust a touch sharper but not enough in my eyes to pick it over the hd regarding sound i think thehas three advantages because it has two speakers and thehas but one it gets noticeably louder thealso has clearer sound to my ears though the difference in volume between the two units is much greater than the sound clarity perhaps most importantly the fire hdit has a speaker design advantage over the the fire hd speakers when the unit is turned landscape are located on either the top of the unit or the bottom of the unit depending on which end you hold up toward the sky in either case your hand will not block the speaker assuming you are holding it on the left and right edges and not the top and the bottom edgesthe fire hd when turned in landscape mode has the one speaker centered on either the left edge or the right edge again depending on which end is facing up bottom line when you hold the fire hd in landscape mode with one hand on the left and right edges you will cover the speaker with one finger or more it doesnt have that much of an impact on the volume or clarity of the sound but it does have someif you plan to listen to the unit largely with headphones or earbuds no big deal as both units sound the same the audio advantage of the hd really only comes into play when listening through the onboard speakersis it worth spending the extra money to get the better audio on the fire hd i think it is particularly if you plan to use the unit a fair amount without earbuds or headphones,positive
844,i bought this to replace my old toshiba thrivetablet and im extremely impressed with how much better this tablet performs than my old thrive ive yet to find an app that bogs it down at all and everything is extremely smooththe os is obviously different than a normal android device but its really easy to get used to if anything its alot more simple than a normal android deviceas an amazon prime member there are tons of awesome perks to having one of these fire tablets amazon musicphotovideo are all justclick awaybest part about these tablets though is obviously the pricefor a pretty fantastic tablet is honestly pretty insane i payed somewhere aroundfor my thrive a few years ago and it wasnt this nice even when it was new,positive
845,this device is so glitchy it hurts my grandmother bought it for me when the one i loved and had for three years broke i can never tell if this one is going to work or not and use have had is since mid september i miss my old one it may not have had the fancy camera like this one does but at least i could count on my books not freezing or the internet to suddenly spaz and stop working i had to turn it off nine times before ticket me post this review,negative
846,like many other users i own multiple kindlesthis one is the perfect sizeman is it quirky though so you put up with a loti buyof my music from amazon so i was planning to get away from appleno luck thereplaylists disappear cant easily be sorted and although i love the concept of amazon prime free music when it takes a full minute to load one of those songs what good is it to have one in your playlistthis evening my tablet cant even find my playlistso frustrating when you have a large one createdi had hoped new updates would fix these quirks but no such lucki repeat though the size is perfect,positive
847,i boughtfire hdtablets for me daughters for christmasboth of them have now stopped workingthey wont charge and they are frozeni would not recommend because they only have aday guarantee,positive
848,i am not sure i can add something that has not already been said but ill try i bought the gb version i already have anand asamsung tablet i bought this mainly because of its size price and for amazons immersion modepros great price very cute fits in pocket better than average screen good performance screen is sharpcons chunky heavy hardware buttons not so good software buttons for home back and menu are a poor substitute for the led versions of the samsungs fonts on some apps are too big it needs more smaller system font options plasticky shell screen not as responsive as it should be battery life does not yet seem long enough given its weight and screen size some apps in amazon store are not the latest screen has muted colors no match for amoled the speaker hard to hear and muffled because it is on the back it should be on side or front clunky interface it is not pure android osive listed a lot of cons but i still believe the pros outweigh them id really rate itout ofstars id recommend it to someone who wants a second or third tablet that is pocket size the screen may be just too small for someones only tabletupdate the plastic shell is very slippery i needed to buy a silicone case for it unfortunately this made it more bulky i find a grippy type case essentialthe screen is good for lcd but very reflective i am tempted to try a nonglare overlay which i generally dont like since it would make the screen less sharpthe software still needs work i find it reboots occasionally while i am reading the book app and audible dont work as well as hoped what amazon calls immersion the play button is sometimes missing from the book or stuck in pause closing and reopening usually cures it sync is a problem sometimes the books open at the wrong pages and if not online it cant sync back to the latest i find that i frequently loose my last read place the book app and the audible app have sync issues too amazon needs to fix the offline syncone other software issue i have discovered is that when reading a kindle book swiping to the right usually reveals the chapter menu rather than going back a page if i then hit a chapter by accident the book goes to that chapter and i loose my page amazon needs better differential between a right swipe and swipe to bring up the chapter menuthe amazon offers are really annoying not targeted at all for my interests i will probably pay to remove themoverall i would lower the star rating tostars until these issues are fixed unfortunately the star rating on these reviews are not editablemayupdateamazon has not updated the os since last february contact and calendar sync from outlook and gmail are not working i called support a while ago but i have received no answers from a usually responsive company the illogical ui and the lack of ability to customize it is taking its toll i would not recommend this as a general use tablet downgrading tostars,neutral
849,i really like the kindle fire as far as userfriendlyness i have a hard time figuring out how to use technology things a lot but it only took me a few minutes to find where everything was the only thing that i dont like about it which is almost enough to make me want to bring it back its so annoying is that the lock screen is ads from amazon like i just want to read a book and play candy crush i dont want any doritos why is there an ad for doritos and i cant figure out how to turn that setting off i dont think its possible and it annoys me to no end so im dockingwhole stars for that thats a horrible way to treat somebody who just spenton your product shoving ads in their face every time they use it,neutral
850,i was in the market for a tablet and with all the various types and brands out there i had to be very realistic and do my home work on what i needed as opposed to what i wanted basically i needed the ability to simply check my email and have access to social media i also didnt want the hassles of lugging around a big bulky lap top or a large note book my fire hd is the perfect size and has all the requirements i need plus other added benefits like the great price and easy to use functions and set up and the portability i require one big plus for me is the camera feature that the fire hd offers i work out in the field alot and having that added camera and the ability to down load to a desktop later is such a big help i gave my fire hd a five star rating,positive
851,i use this more than my phone now when im at home just trying to preserve phone life since its cost istimes that of the fire screen is perfect for youtube amazon netflix it is faster than i thought it would be too the price cant really be beat because the quality is on par with much more expensive ones,neutral
852,for starters i love the size fits perfectly in my bag for easy grab n gothe functionality of the fire is fairly straight forward just some slight personal adjustment with the placement of buttons as compared to other devicessetup is super easy and adding apps is also a breezeas would be expected reading books on the device is comfortable and downloaded quicklythe only negative is that the device has froze a couple of times requiring it to be rebootedthere are also a few apps like youtube that are not available but hope that they will be available in the futureall in all for the price you cannot beat the functionality of browsing online and reading books,positive
853,this is a good tablet especially at this pricei purchased the hd to replace my kindle paperwhite for browsing reading news and booksit has exceeded my expectationswifi setup was very easyalthough it is a bit thicker and weighs slightly more than the paperwhite i have no problem holding it for an hour or so while reading articlesglare has not been a issue with the hd though i decided to keep my paperwhite for longer readingi have amazon prime and have enjoyed listening to the included music on the hdi find the reading view feature in the silk browser very usefulthe charge seems to last a couple of days with maybehours use per daythat seems adequate,negative
854,great tablet great pricebought foryear old son which he loves because of amazon free time kids appi am not tech savvy but i thoughtgb would be more than enough for a few books apps and picswhich he loves to take pics and make short videoswas i way wrong i am constantly having to delete apps or games because it keeps running low on storagei am not sure how to fix this problem or clear memory in a better way but that is a huge downsideit does not have a memory card slotat least not one that i have foundoverall great deal for a kids tabletgreat parental controlsawesome for kindle cloud or amazon cloud use because this will not effect device storagegreat product if you have prime account,neutral
855,let me say i love my fire i have owned an ipad for a few years and would carry it to work for lunchtime reading the size and weight of it was filling up my purse and heavy to carry so when i saw the fire i knew that was the solution i can read my kindle books check my email surf the net and my purse isnt so heavy since i always have it with me i can listen to audio books while crafting driving or relaxing too and the plug in for external speakers is great when i need it in my noisy studio a perfect solution to all my needsand now when my grandson comes to visit and commandeers the ipad to play his games i have my fire as my tablet it was a great purchase for me,positive

858,i purchasedof the kindle fire hdfor my kids agesandthey were very excited with their new toys but going from an ipad mini to an android layout device with no home button was very difficult and frustrating for them to use the display was nice on the kindle not as clear as an ipad but clear the parental controls was pretty cool to keep my kids from making unwanted app purchases but was also a hassle to have to get apps and always turn the parental controls offon every time the speaker on the kindle is also very small and muffled sounding i returned both kindles and purchased ipad minis for my kids again,negative
859,i was a bit skeptical getting the smaller one but i love it was disappointed the color i wanted was out of stock until decbut thats a minor thingi use it for reading email reading some articles on sites like nflcom and nhlcom a few games like stupid zombies and a few other basic tasksas with the previous gen kindle the only downside of this tablet is the new kindle fire osi wish their was a choice in which kindle fire os to get as i enjoyed the original bestbut the speaker works well for when i listen to music during dishes or other choresi like that the battery lasts longer than my previousinch kindle and i am pleased with how it feels in my handi also like the screen very nice and my eyes do not get tired from the screen,neutral
860,i like it i warn you that this review is about how i use the fire hdand that may be very different than most people buying the kindle in my case the purchase was the replacement for my ipodi have burned through ipod in the last couple of years and didnt want the expense to replace the last one i used the ipods to listen to my audible book and that was the purpose of getting the kindle the kindle does far more than the ipod did with more memory and other options available to me that i may never use but they are therewhat it like the price for one thing this kindle is half the price of what a replacement ipod would have been and without giving up any of the features i would have had with an ipodi like the size its isnt that iphoneipod size i had but it still small enough to not be clumsy to use it the way i use it i like that i can very easily get to the settings to switch between earphone and bluetoothi like that if i wanted to i can easily use this as a reader to a moviei liked that it took me no time to set it upbasically all i had to do was turn it oni like that the download is much fast than with ipodwhat i dont mind i was not thrilled that i couldnt get a version of this without the ads however this has not been an issueits the opening page and once you click and swipe the ad it gonewhat i dont likei wish there was a little better marriage between amazon and audible if audible has a feather any amazon product should be able add that feature for instance audible now has the cool feature that isolates a clip of a bookthis is a great feature and something id love to be able to use so far i cannot,neutral

862,ima start my review by saying this is the best tablet what can i say this tablet works way better and faster then my lgg anyway i bought this kindle fire at office depot a year an a half ago at first the tablet was acting weird guess it was a software issues a couple updates fix it battery life is great hope this kindle fire lasts for good thanks amazon i love buying your stuff,neutral
863,i love my little kindle fire i have an ipad and its good but i cant take it with me everywhere i go my kindle does it fits perfectly into my handbag stuck in traffic time to read a book waiting in line at the grocery store time to read a book seriously i love it i bought the gb version and bought a case for it and i couldnt be happier well i guess if a stylus was included i would be even happier but as is its perfect for a little tablet the sound is really good i dont have any problems watching a movie or listening to music granted amazon doesnt offer as many apps as google or apple but what they have is sufficient for me,positive
864,really enjoy the my first tablet works well for what we use it for mainly web browsing facebook and netflix i have played hearthstone on it its certainly better for that than my phone for the price its hard to beat the value of the device screen is sharper than expected but the onboard speaker leaves something to be desired if you want to install a lot of apps spend the extra cash on thegb model the os takes up a lot of space,positive
865,this it the first kindle fire i have owned its very small and compact with a nice display its perfect for reading books and playing games its not the best for surfing the web though moves pretty slow one thing i dont like is that you have to press kind of hard on the screen its nice that there are multiple colors to choose from i also like that it has a seperate account for your child to use and you can control what they readwatchplay and for how long its really cool because you dont have to worry about ur child doing or messing with stuff they shouldnt be overall its a pretty good buy i received the kindle fire for free,neutral
866,i own a samsung stablet and i own a dragon touchtablet while both are very good i bought the amazon fire hd i love this tablet above all othersi find that the size is just perfect to carry in my purse but at the same time i can see movies and tv shows without a problem in fact i feel that the resolution is better and the picture is sharper than my other tabletsi also like the price ofit makes it an affordable gift to give to someonei am a prime member so it really enables me to take advantage of all aspects of my membershipi ordered this tablet in whiteit does come in other colors which is also a plus black is boring but the colors just add to the style and looks of this tableti also ordered a cover to fit from finite i am still waiting for the cover which is due to come any day but i have bought finite before and i love their covers i highly recommend this tableti use this tablet for banking games email facebook twitter shopping listening to radio stations around the country hulu plus netflix and overdriveoverdrive allows me to borrow books videos audiobooks from my local library and return them via my tablet i never have to go to the library at all and yet i can obtain various media i also use the tablet for skype it has dual cameras which make it ideal for photos or skypeone last thing i love the cloudi store most of my items in the cloudit is a wonderful serviceyou always have your documents files etc safely at your disposal to install on your tableti ordered thegb without ads i would suggest getting that one,positive
867,the battery life is just awful its dropped fromtowithinminutes i am deeply considering returning this for a different kindle the screen size is amazing and as is the image clarity but i need a better that will last far more than just a few hours,neutral
868,the fire hdis the perfect size it fits comfortably in my hand without it cramping up when holding it for a long period of time what i love about the fire hdis that it is the perfect size to read books i wear glasses and did not how to squint to read i can also listen to music play games check your emails and you can even skype searching for something in the silk browser is a snap i can search for anything and it will show up in the search engine amazon makes the best tablets period i received this kindle for free in exchange for an honest review,positive
869,i am not real big on all the technical stuff but i can say this i like it i found it easy to use much easier than the tablet i tried before this i like that i was able to actually work it again much better than the one i tried before this i am enjoying reading my books on it which is what i use it for mostly i have used the camera as well and it takes fairly decent photos but you have to hold it so still while doing it i was a little disappointed i didnt see a place for an sd card but yet i really dont need it either i guess well i certainly would say it is worth getting so what ya waiting for go get one,neutral
870,i really like thefire hd i needed another tablet to be able to listen to audio textbooks for school since my other table was often in use by another family member this great little fire hd works perfectly i like the additional functionality that the fire has within the kindle app for notes xray highlights that i cannot use on my ipad or other devices in the same way i absolutely love the audio translation of my kindle books which is handy when trying to get a little reading in while on a treadmill the price was a factor and felt forthis is a great buy very crisp screen resolution and quick screen refresh and motion response,neutral
871,i bought this for my daughters birthday and she loves itits the right size weight screen resolution and pricethe battery holds up really well way longer than i was initially anticipatingits a little on the heavier side but if i can get great battery life then so be itim purchasing a couple more of these due to the great screen resolution battery speaker software and of course the pricethe amazon ecosystem is on pointgreat job amazonlooking forward to seeing the next iteration of this later in the year,negative
872,i got three of these for my kids for christmas i soon found out that i should have done more homework prior to purchasingthough this device runs off android kitkat you do not have access to the google play store you are limited to amazons library and there are quite a few apps which you cannot get through amazon the device is okay not nearly as responsive or quick as my old tabim also not a fan that your amazon account has to be set up on it its much harder to navigate than my old tabhad i knownexperienced the fire prior to purchasing i would have skipped it and purchased the tabwhich was priced for the same amount when i was looking,neutral

875,ive had some version of the most recent kindle since well since there was only the paperwhite only we didnt call it that we called it a kindle and it had this great feature folders books could be categorized and subcategorized into folders just as we do today with files on a computer amazon please consider bringing this feature back avid readers like me need to be able to sort books by more than just author title and recent collections is a step in the right direction but it only goes one level deep folders would allow sorting books in a number of ways,positive

877,excellent display combined with prime well worth the investment upgrading togb strongly advised so that if one gets prime videos theres room to download playback is then smooth at hd a big advantage over services like netflix and hulu which only streamhad theincher before which was good also but this is a nifty upgrade especially on a low budget since the gb can be had atmonthly paymentssacrifice of playstore is notable of course but lots of apps available thru amazonno complaints about this at all,positive
878,i ordered two of these as birthday gifts soon after unboxing within a couple of days we began to notice that at times the devices would not turn on they had aroundcharge and took several minutes to turn back on eventually we had to return one because it just would not turn no matter what charged it all night as well as tried multiple reboots the other device we have had originally from the beginning has not had any issues since the first couple of days we bought it amazon customer service was great with getting us a replacement for the nonworking one and now all seems to be back in order,positive

883,just received this as a gift so i havent had it longthis was going to replace my old kindle but i have to say i dont see that happening as the battery doesnt last longi get that it is using power for all the bells and whistles but my old old old one of the originals goes like the energizer bunny on cracki read a lot and only charge once or twice a month i have to recharge this at the end of the daycant see taking it on a trip when i can charge the old one and never worry about it til i get homeif you basically just want to readgo with a basic kindleif you want to check email and play games just remember the battery is not long lastingupdatepiece of junkwont hold a charge and takes forever to rechargehave to shut off and on several times before it will go online and then have to shut off and on several times to get anything to downloaduse my old old kindle for most things and occasionally play solitaire on this one but it dies so fast it is not worth the hasslefeel sorry for my kids wasting money on thisdont bother getting ityou will be disappointed,negative

885,the kindle fire hdis a compact little world with everything you need included i had the first kindle when it first came out and i must say i thoroughly enjoy this kindle the kindle fire hd is clear crisp and adequate and fast when finding information i am a graduate student and if you use a lot of textbooks and highlighters the kindle fire hdis the perfect alternative and the highlighting is impeccable i have not explored everything this piece of perfection has to offer but i know i will never be bored because the kindle fire hdmuch more to offer than any other tablet <U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E38><U+383C><U+3E30><U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E38><U+383C><U+3E30><U+653C><U+3E64><U+613C><U+3E30><U+623C><U+3E64><U+653C><U+3E64><U+623C><U+3E38><U+383C><U+3E30>,positive
886,this is my rd kindle fire i didnt care for it as much as myor the inch kindle the silk browser is very slow and never really connects to the web it fits in your hand a little better but it feels cheap i have the magenta color and i noticed the color is already rubbing off after a few months of trying to make myself like this i just gave it to my husband to use,neutral
887,i love it for you daughter she thinks she is so grown up now that she has her own tablet in a pretty color i would recommend getting one with more storage once there is low storage on the device it stops connecting to wifi and i have to go threw delete archive much of her stuff then causes a melt down because i inevitably deleted the game show she was trying to watch,negative
888,we bought kindle fires for ourdaughterswe have ipads but wanted something for them to use that is smaller and just for themi thought that i could have myyear old use it to look up info for school homeworkthis does not have parental controls for the internetit is all or nothingeven thought you set up a profile with their age in the parental controls sectionif i had known this i would have spent the extra money and got a device that allows explicit content to be blockedvery disappointing that amazon does not have this feature,positive
889,the tablets are great the only draw back is that my daughter wasnt able to use snapchat which was a big turn off for her other than that the camera was also mediocre i think it needs some improvements in those areas the indestructible shell and screen makes it ideal for kids lightningco,positive
890,i still cannot believe that i just paidtax for this awesome device definitely buy this if you are looking for quality and compact product kudos to amazon for this device at such a price i will definitely recommend this to my friends you are getting much more than whatever you are payingvery happy with my fire hdgb hk,positive
891,i was so excited to get a fire instead of my old kindle keyboard g which finally died after many years i received it last night and started to read a book this morning after aboutpages it froze it wouldnt let me turn the page i was able to get out of the book and go back in when i opened the book it had taken me backpages or so and i had to hunt for the page i was actually on it happened three times i am now sending it back and getting a paperwhite i wish they still made the kindle that i used to have extremely disappointed,negative
892,great little tablet so far most games are compatible with this tablet some thou are not which is a bit disappointing this is a cheap tablet that allows access to most applications int the amazon store the screen looks nice it is medium speed in browsing and plays most games finenice thing is i have played walking dead wolf among us table top racing and skylandersthe form factor is super small for a tablet yet has a lot of functionalitythis tablet is suppose to be for young kids but i feel that it fits really nice into an nitch gaming environment that adults might use instead of the bulkierorinche tabletsi have used it with the ipeg an wow it feels just like a ps vita but with much better controls and screen,neutral
893,small size makes it perfect as an ereader plus it can read it to you as an audio bookgb works well for me but i recommend gettinggb too bad that it doesnt take voice commands like on google i also have the firewhich i suggest as a better buy,positive
894,pretty good overall my wife bought it for me as a gifti thought i would be a little bigger and i would have better control over font size but all in all i like it very much its my first ereader,positive
895,frustrating to use freezes all the time home button is difficult to fine it isnt external and recent updates have made it even less user friendly i wont even use it anymore pointless reminded me why i buy apple product and have since bought an ipad mini which i love,neutral
896,i am writing this review on the tablet now i always wait to review until i have owned a product for a while this tablet has stood the test of timeof course i would like one of the more expensive tabletsbut this one was in my price range so i did a bunch of research and this was the one that appealed to me the mosti have no regrets with this purchase some complain about the screen size and the low memory spacei have found neither to be a problem in fact i enjoy the small screen sizeit is a great tablet and i would recommend,neutral
897,bought this for my grandma recently as her old one wasn’t working properly anymore and she loves it the size is great and she is able to use it easily even though she is not the most fluent with computers and electronics she likes to use it to play games read books and articles on line and lets the grandkids use it for their games definitely would purchase again,positive
898,i loved myfire so much we bought each of our children one for christmas i love the new free time and family share options it made it so easy to give my children ages vary fromtotheir own content that is age appropriate without worrying that they could access everything on mine and my husbands accounts they can watch read listen to and play what we allow and nothing more we got them each a different color which also helps keep them separate they arrived quickly and beautifully packaged we will definitely stay with the fire family of products and recommend them to anyone thinking of electronics,positive
899,having used the larger kindle i wondered if i would really like the smaller version i do it can easily fit into my purse or my husbands briefcase or even perhaps his suit pocket the good news is that the smaller size does not sacrifice clarity the print is great and still easy to read this kindle was easy to set up and accepted apps without any problems i was a little disappointed that it did not have stereo sound and the camera seems limited to daytime exposure however over all this is a really great reader i chose the dark royal blue and like that too very happy with my choice,neutral
900,had a dell before this and liked it much better maybe in time i will get use to its fussiness learning i have to shut of wireless after every use hate that the google app sucks battery life good so far easy to handle,positive
901,love thesei got them when they were reduced pricedollars a piece for my two third gradersgood quality and price forelementary aged children to readplay games or watch tvlike that they came in many color choices still working strong with no issues almostyears later,positive
902,i have had thetablet formonths and it has been good for what i use it foruntil the latest silk browser updatenow when i am on sites on the admittedly small screenthere is a status bar that never used their be there which diminishes the size of the screen byan inchtotally unnecessarynever missed this feature before but i miss that screen real estatedumb move amazon,neutral
903,im very impressed and pleased with be tableti have all the kids at my house or when babysitting enjoy using the games from the apps i get i get to enjoy displaying it on my tv for netflix and i get to read my books through itlove it so much sure it could use maybe some additional speakers if using to watch tv or a movie but its still awesome,neutral
904,the fire hd ” is a solid tablet for those on a budget it’s compact and lightweight for practical portability the screen is clear luminous and the perfect in between size for watching videos playing games etc i am a longtime mac user and don’t expect much from anything other but i find this tablet useful for what i need i use a tablet for basic tasks reading kindle books web surfing games music and the fire works well but falls short in an area i desperately require… sound the audio quality is less than desired and headphones are pretty much always needed all and all for the price it can’t be beat,positive
905,easy to use and affordable my old kindle crashed and wouldnt hold a charge anymore and i found that i simply could not live without it i love that it came in hot pink i did wish it was a bit bigger but the larger size was not in my budget they did go on sale a few days later of course but thats the way the cookie crumblesi like the ease of use and how simple it is to get rid of books you have readthis is my third kindle and they get so much better with timei also like the amazon radio functionwell done amazon,positive
906,this product has been a disappointmenti bought for basic browsing emailand some video viewing i bought refurbished on prime dayit was quickly replaced as defective under warranty the replacement seemed ok for about a weekthen it stopped connecting to wifi and started takinghours to charge the amazon charger has failed so i use my phone,neutral
907,i brought this as a present for my husband and im very disappointed in it as is he he acts like it likes it since it was a gift but i know he doesnt at alleverything you do you have to through amazon and that is very time consumingyou have to buy free apps through amazon and to me that is a waste of time and senselessit is all to difficult for me husbandwe also have a nook and it is so much easier for him to operator and download games and apps is much easier alsovery disappointed in the kindle firethinking about returning it,neutral
908,it smaller than fire hdbut quality is so different much worse and it does wired thingonce in a while it turns off completely it supposed to be in sleep and turns on when you press button and wont startyou need to wait and try again when it will turn onits not worth spending moneyi bought aboutkindle fire and all other models are finei just dont suggest this model,neutral
909,i thought i was ordering the same size kindle as my old fire but its actually an inch smaller at first i was disappointed but that quickly went away first off all its pink its such a fun vibrant color it fits my personality and it looks perfect with the cover so really what more could i want oh yeah vivid display bright colors good battery life quick charging and speaker quality it has all that too im so happy with this purchase,positive
910,absolute worst tablet i have ever used i bought two of these for my kids thinking the low price was ideal to give them something to play with and i wouldnt be upset if they dropped it and it shattered they are more of a headache than anything they constantly freeze and have to be rebooted the battery life is ridiculously shorthours maybe and they overheat if use in any sort of case which they need to be in to protect them as much as i despise how apple items become obsolete quickly at least they do what they are intended to do what a waste of money,negative
911,got this used in acceptable condition well it was in mint condition and close to newwas a steal beautiful display very responsive plays games without lag movies look great music sounds good osis an improvement overfeels great holding it and fits in more places then theinch size installing google play was simple and took less thenminutes every app i need or want is in my hands its crazy how you can get such beauty like this at such a low price wont hesitate to buy used again as it almost looks new anyways great device for all my basic and not so basic needs,neutral
912,i purchased a kindle fire from you in decemberin the last couple of months it has started freezing up when i type something the letters freeze or it puts the wrong letter in i love my kindle fire and hate that it is a piece of crap i used it a lot and enjoyed playing games on it and reading this is the third one i have purchased from you the first was a refurbished one and lasted a long time the second i purchased for my grand daughter then i purchased this last one which was new i am so disappointed in this product will not be ordering another one,negative

914,i bought this for myyear old and she has filled it up an insurmountable amount of timeseach time as i delete items off her tablet there seems to be less and less storage capabilitywithout completely resetting it i am not sure what else i can delete this go around since it no longer connects to wifi in order to access and remove picturesvideosappsi will be calling amazon later to try to troubleshoot however myyear oldsgb tablet is wonderful as is myin hdx i have added several movies and apps without any issues at all i recommend the higher gb for sure,neutral
915,nice tablet as advertisedi could have used some written instructions to get started but there was none in the packageluckily i had a touch screen monitor on my desktop so i played with the tablet and fin ally got to a page where i could get some help screensit would be helpful to have a few hints from amazon in the package that would have saved me some timestill not sure i have covered everything yet but it works find at all functions that i have tried,neutral
916,do you know what new coke windowsand this fire hd have in commonthey all took a working formula that people loved and changed it to something betterwhen i first got the amazon fire hdi found myself using it a lot more then i thought i wouldi liked it so much that i finally merged my amazon and audible account and signed up for amazon prime something ive been holding off doing for yearsusing the amazon fire hdfelt natural it was amazingi picked it up with my smart phone and started to wish i didnt have to carry my smartphone tootheyre booth android basedi liked the amazon fire better then my ipad minii liked the size better the heft better and the interface betteri was going to give the amazon fire hdfour out of five stars with the only thing i didnt like was that i wasnt able to buy it without the ads on the lock screen at the time and that i couldnt upgrade to get rid of them as far as i knowwell im glad i didnt finish that reviewthey all took a working formula and tried to change it to something betteramazon took something that used to feel like an extension of my brain and made me have to think about itthey took the interface that was natural and invisible and made it very very visibleso now i have to do a lot of mental exorcise when all i want to do is mentally relax its like they chopped off my arm and replaced it with a prosthetic arm no offense to anyone with prosthetics seriously and now i feel anger resentment and i find things that i used to do without thought or effort to now be very difficult and even frustratingso where you were part of me amazon fire hdnow i resent you,neutral
917,i originally bought the fire hdfor my husband for valentinesi loved his so much i bought myself oneso improved over the first fire back inwe are now a three kindle fire familyin fact i like my kindle fire more then my ipadit is so easy to useeven my husband finds it easy to navigate and hes not computer literatewe love the hd front and rear camera and the bluetooth which syncs up easily in the carslightly larger than an iphone and smaller than the original kindle fireall around its a good deal,positive
918,had i read the full details of this item and not impulse buy on what i thought was a good dealits filled with ads from the lock screen the home page and under app icons dont want to see thempaywith achargethe interface is clumsy at bestthe scrolling carousel cant be removed and will see all the recent apps used no one swipe removal but a tedious hold and remote of each iconjust trying to customize this is needlessly complicated in fact it seems like you cant even customize it to your personal likingall these complaints i listed are pretty minor but all together they add put what makes it so infuriating is that it seems like its a decent little tablet ruined by amazonthis will be my last impulse buy at amazon and purchase in general for a while highly dissapoting,negative
919,its a decent tablet for the pricethe video camera is not nearly as good as its implied to berear facing hd camera has lots of floaters and fuzz especially indoors i would say that its not hd even though its advertised to bealso noteno sd card port noneyoure going to need an external hard driveinternet connection is very fastgmail is advertised but not includeddoes not connect to google store by default it requires a tiny bit of knowledge hacking and jailbreaking to do so,neutral

922,i bought this tablet last minute because i was about to brave the hour flight to ireland i was skeptical at first because of some of the negative reviews but i went ahead with the purchase anyway i am so happy i bought this when i was looking for a tablet i wanted something compact that i could play games read books and stream videos with and that is exactly what this tablet will allow you to do for a very low price the battery life survived my days of travel with moderate use overall i believe this was a very good decision because since purchasing the tablet i have already gotten my moneys worth highly recommend,neutral
923,i received the fire hdas a christmas gift first the good its a great size for reading ebooks i can hold it one handed which is perfect it also has a great screen for streaming video the amazon app store is kinda limited compared to google play but most major apps are there one thing though is the os that comes on the fire is kinda lanky luckily i searched about if its upgradeable to fire osand found out about the developer preview its pretty straightforward on how to sign up and receive the preview just do a search for fire hddeveloper preview and follow the directions you find fire osruns flawlessly on this tablet its much closer in looks to android which i find much better since i received this as a gift i didnt get to pick the amount of storage and i got the gb model its fine for my use though as i dont play many games on tablets or phones if all you use it for is reading books streaming video and serfing the web it works completely fine and all the major video streaming services are there also if you are a prime member its perfect for all the benefits you receive if you want some games though and have a choice id recommend that you get the gb modelnow the neither pro or con for me is the lock screen ads some people find them incredibly annoying i however dont find them annoying at all if they bug you that bad pay theand have them removednow to the negative the one major flaw is lack of a micro sd card slot while its great for streaming i cant download but one or two movies to watch without running out of storage while im almost always around wifi and can stream there are times that im not and would like to be able to have more that one and at the most two movies saved for offline viewing one other con is the lack of google play i understand that amazon is competitor to google and wants you to use their own apps and services its an annoyance to those of us who have apps and movies bought through google although it is possible to root and install google play or even not root and sideload the play store and play services to make it work it would be much less a hassle if it came on the fire in the first place oh and if you are wondering no i will not provide info on how to make that work just do a search and find a tutorial on how to but know that its a workaround and it may be buggy and an update from amazon may make it quit working at any time one last con are the cameras i tried to take a few pictures with it and they turned out terrible but i havent ever relied on a tablet for pictures though maybe if they would have left the rear camera off they could have made room for an sd card slotso thats my review if youre a prime member stream video from netflix hulu hbo now showtime or and other major streaming service or love to read its perfect the size is just right to hold one handedif you require google play a bigger screen and cant live without an sd slot or more storage this is not the device for for you move along and look elsewhere,neutral
924,this was my favorite tablet i was expecting an android tablet which was not the case i had to sideload some apps such as zillow komplet and twilight but apart from this small nuisance everything is great i loved ituntil i forgot it inside an american airlines flightnever to be found again i bought a fireafterwards and i didnt like itother thing of notice is that i thought theprevious launcher more organized even being less beautiful it as also lighterbottom line worth every penny,positive
925,this has locked up every time we try to use an app it locks up constantlyever since we bought it we have had issues i was very frustrated and was told to reset everything to factory settings and we still had issues but then when i called again they are replacing it free of charge no questions asked they said it should have never had those issues to begin with so very pleased with customer service ill let you know when we get the new one,negative
926,this tablet has surpassed my expectations i am a college student and wanted a device for media consumption and something i wouldnt notice having in my bag this kindle is awesome it is the perfect size to enjoy reading a textbook or for watching youtube videos the amazon store seems to be growing and ive found some of my favorite apps if you are on the fence this tablet packs a punch for a cheap price,positive

928,after readingbooks in the past two weekssurfing the web playing on facebook and morei really love my kindle fire hdi love the handheld size of it and all the feature like cloudthe amount of space on it and because of the cloud is amazing i do wish that there was a instagram app to download the camerais not the greatest and the battery dies kinda fast but other then that its awesome so i gave four stars we will probably be ordering two more for the kids very sooni review this kindle in exchange for my unbiased review of itthank you,positive
929,it is small but easy to handle i have an hours commute on the train and the size is perfect for seatsharing i dont disturb my neighbor with a regular size book or even a regularsized kindle it drops into my messenger bag when im finished very nice extremely pleased,positive
930,still learning takes a few minutes after you touch some of the apps that small circle goes round and round even after i upgraded my interment speed it seems to be a nice tablet maybe i need to learn more about it it doesnt come with a booklet about how to use it,neutral
931,this was a good value and works well i am a long time user of the kindle this is a smaller version of my original one i think it tends to run a little too hot though so i am careful with it maybe the battery overheats,positive
932,in general i enjoy the device however theis a bit small so i might recommend thethe battery dies very quickly while in use but also rather quickly when it is on standby not the biggest deal i just need to remember to shut it down when i am not using it sort of a painthe main issue i have is that i bought this tablet basically at the same time as the fire tv stick i wanted to use them together it appears in the description that you can however it only seems to let me do second screen which isnt all that its cracked up to be when i try to play my own videos music or pictures from the device it takes me to some folders where that data is not stored the only items i really can play are amazon videos or music that basically makes the fire hda better remote control for the fire stick what i really want to do is mirror my hdit appears as though this is possible in the hdx and amazon phone models one simple goes to display options and turns on mirror casting why is this not an option in the hd will it get fixed with software or firmware updatesi really want to mirror my hd summarypretty decent for the pricebattery dies quicklyno mirroring,positive
933,i bought this tablet mainly for the size i wanted something more portable and convenient i got that and so much more i love the fact that it is from amazon and i have an amazon prime account i love to be able to down load shows or movies and watch them later off line it has just about everything i need it doesnt have itunes or instagram as apps which is a little disappointing but certainly not a deal breaker i would definitely buy a fire in the future,neutral
934,this is my first tablet purchase i was looking for a kindle reader and saw this an option which includes web browsing etc which means i dont have to drag my laptop around or read emails on my iphone the only thing i would reconsider would be getting the unit with g connectivity option,positive
935,i wanted something to read books on but also have some access to the interneti bought the fire hd because it had great reviewswell i purchased some books i paid for these booksthey werent free and downloaded themafter about a week the books disappeared from my firei had to download againat first i thought it was a glitch but it kept happeningso i called amazon and they told me it needed an os updatei triedtimes withdifferent reps to get the fire to update its os but to no availfinally the last guy said id have to return it because it was defectivei asked him if i would be getting a new one back because i didnt want this happening againhe said yes via chati sent everything back and they sent me a refurbished one without an adapter so i couldnt even charge the darn thingi called back and complained saying that i had it in writing that i would be getting a new one back afterminutes of arguing they finally agreed to send me a new onei got the new one and guess whatthe fire cant update its os and my paidfor books still disappear from itits an absolutely worthless piece of junkill never buy another kindle againill go with a nook or somethingreally really disappointed,neutral
936,sadlyafter i spent a good amount of time programing this tablet to all my specifics with the help of a friendand spending quite a bit of time learning how to use iti found out that the power buttondidnt work and it wouldnt turn offthis was really disappointing after i had wanted one for a long time and after spending time i really didnt have learning how to use iti sent it back for a refund,positive
937,i tried out the most recent fire hdand sent it back in favor of the hdthe hdhas louder speakers though even those arent as good as the ones on the fire hdwhich has now become the hdx model still the sound quality on the hdis goodand the pixels per inch are higher than on the hdi moved to the hdbecause i wanted a smaller device easier to handle and carry in my purse the hdis great in that regard i also wanted to be able to download prime instant video and prime music for offline use so i chose the larger capacitygb model this device isnt that great for getting work done but i use my ipad for that anyway and didnt buy the fire for that purpose the other big plus for me is ease of use with my large kindle and audible book libraries its easy to access and use either or both including for immersion reading which i sometimes use the fire also allows for texttospeech on some books which comes in handy as an audible alternative its a computer voice and so not nearly as enjoyable as audible but the voice quality is not bad considering in summary this is a very nice rightsize device thats especially useful for those wanting easy access to amazons digital products,positive
938,my grandson wanted one of these for a while i decided to surprise him i ordered it and had it shipped to my daughters house he didnt know about it so the day it arrived my daughter acted like she didnt see the package on the porch he picked it up and said mom it has my name on it when inside he opened it and was really excited he called and thanked me i could hear the joy in his voice that joy and his sincere thanks meant the world to me,positive
939,the fire hddisplay was perfect in so many ways great picture color and clarityseamless operating system and thatinche size was such a great fit i loved it then i tried to put the sd card in and discovered that it did not take a sd card i was very disappointedi usually have aboutsongs downloadedtobooks downloaded and play several gamesit was with a heavy heart that i returned it if it had expandable memoryi would have given itstars,positive
940,we have two of these one for my husband and one for the myself and the kids to use they are pretty fantastic as far as durability is concerned mine has been dropped more times than i count in the year and a half we have had it and the screen has yet to crack for reading its great so long as you have the screen dimming app that takes the backlight down to kindle level for entertainment i love that it is so easily connected to prime products and still allows streamers like netflix however i hate that it isnt compatible with vudu we have a lot of movies through that particular media app and often buy dvds amazon take note whim purchases of kids movies dont happen online they happen in grocery and department stores when out running errands that come with the digital copies that are exclusive to vudu we would probably buy the bigger better fire tablets if they werent so finicky about what you can use with them i get that amazon does this as way to lock buyers into hopefully buying their media through them but in a world where smart devices that are universally capable we have other devices we can use to access the media id say if we found ourselves in need of new tablets we probably would check out something else that is less limited in this respectbeing limited to primes titles kinda stinks when you know you have a host of other movies you own but cannot watch on it without repurchasing and frankly im not going to pay for a movie twice,neutral
941,i was going to buy an ipad for a larger screen to read ebooks but had trouble logging into my apple account my daughter recommended looking at the kindle fire i ended up buying thefire what a bargain compared to comparable apple products i had been reading my ebooks on my ipod now im a convert to the fire ………i still love my macbook and my ipod but fire is my go to readerlate night google search email checklook at facebook tweet hilarious comments in the middle of the night……this could go on for ever so ill just stop but buy one,positive
942,i would give it astar but there are quirks that i found that i had on my other kindle fire i miss placing certain web pages as device favorite kindle fire hd all is placed under favoritesthe screen on fire hd could have a little more sensitivity i find tapping several times can be annoyingusing the keyboard on fire hd there is no cap lockand the most annoying is the sound from the fire hd is not good unless you use earphonesother then my quirks i would recommend the kindle fire hd,neutral
943,an awesome tablet that can handle anything that you throw at it from games to movies it does everything and anything the only one thing that i dont like about this fire is that the google play store is not available on the kindle limited choices of apps,neutral
944,not enough memory the memory is not expandable and the system takes up gb so you are not left with much my son had to constantly delete things of his device so he had sufficient memory look for one with expandable memory,negative
945,i bought my fireused on ebay for aboutthis is by far the best budget tablet ive usedpersonally i feel its well worthsale price its going for at the moment i was going back and forth between the fireandthe new th genallows you to use an sd card and ischeaperi bought thebecause i wanted a smaller tablet i can easily carry aroundi tether this tablet to my phones personal hotspot so i have access to wifi anywhere however if you have amazon prime video you can download all the movies and watch offline so if i were to buy a new fire i would buy the gb version enjoy this great little tablet you wont regret it,positive
946,i was debating on whether i needed to get this since i already had a kindlehowever i never really use it or take it with me anywhere because of the sizei was able to take advantage of the prime day deal and get this one for more memory on sale and i am sooo happy thati didi love thekindlei love to read and now i finally have a tablet that i dont mind carrying around with me,positive
947,perfect size for reading in bedui is easy to use and intuitive and surfing the web is a breeze using thisonly downside is perhaps that the battery seems to drain a bit fast unless turned completely offstill i love this product,positive
948,so far ive contacted customer service twiceonce for a freeze the other time for constant restartsremains to be seen whether corrective actions will workits better but not free of random restartsthis is my second kindle fire and it definitely doesnt work as well as my firstin any case customer service is putting me through the hoops before approving a returnthis hasnt been my experience with amazon in the pasttoo bad,positive
949,i sure do love this little hd firei have anhdx which is wonderful but i find it too large to be really convenient this hdis more light weight easier to handle and has more options then my hd firewhich i passed on to my young granddaughter this is the th the kindle that i have purchased ive given three as gifts and i havefor myself one is g keyboard they all are still working beautifullyits great the way i can download any of my books and music from the amazon cloud,positive
950,kind of disappointing the amazon app store does not have a lot of variety or chose from there are many apps that are apple and android compatable but there is little selection with these apps,negative
951,this is my rd kindle and i absolutely love it its very easy to use i like the smaller shape and easier carousel screen i have bought this same kindle for both of my kids who areandmyyr old also uses it i like the free time kids app on it its durable i love the kindle brand and would continue to buy it my only complaint is the charging port on kindleskindles have each had their charging port malfunction and i am no longer able to charge it other than that i have never had any issues,positive
952,probably im the only one who doesnt want the kindle to be my second computer or game consuli want it for reading i miss the easy navigation tools of the paperwhite the kindle is very slow to almost not responding to my touch i miss that when i buy a book it doesnt download over and includes the sample i just read i miss the quick response of the paperwhite i wish the kindle were a little lighter weight that being said i like the hd color aspect and wonder if i read a book with color pictures would they show up in color also always necessary the choice of style and size of font the colors and very bestaddition is the blue light shield for reading in bed,neutral
953,very happy with thegb version initially purchased thegb version anticipating aboutgb of usage however was very disappointed that there were onlygb so i returned it and bought this one the actual on device storage wasgb which is perfect for me it works perfectly both for books and for internet apps that i was interested in before purchasing my only concern was that the display for book reading might not be as good as on my husbands paperwhite but in the rooms where i use it there is no problem its definitely worth the price,positive
954,pleasantly surprised that my fire hdcamedays earlier than expected also a surprise the battery was installed and nearly fully charged i plugged it in and charged it completely before use there was a software update that i downloaded which gave me easy access to prime music and the washington posts appfree formonthsput my new kindle through its paces and got overhours of mixed usewifi setup email and social media setup book downloads and internet still hadof the battery charge remaininggreat little tablet amazon,neutral
955,im a little bit older so this isnt as easy to read like myfire but i was looking forward to the convenience of a smaller tabletim on my third replacement because the battery dies out so fasti fully charged it when i received it set it up turned it offnext time i started it i was atchecked to make sure my new books were on there turned it offnext time i started it i was ati wasnt doing anything on it or using it for more than five minutesthis is the worst,neutral
956,the graphics are crystal clear amazing hd on such a small sized tablet not too small though the size is wonderfulnot heavy at all like the original kindle fire i love this tablet so muchi ordered the pink one and its very prettythe battery life is very long i charge it once a week i use it to read books only though so farother uses may drain the battery faster but i am notsure,positive
957,i purchased this unit primarily for a long tripi wanted a unit for all the basic functions of a kindle but also wanted to be able to do some word processing and to take picturesthis unit does both of those as advertised i was very pleased with the ease and quality of the picturesmy wife and i both used the word processing function i would recommend this unit to othersa great member of the kindle family,positive
958,a windows user the now operating system took some time to understand but the help function is good and i am slowly getting to use all the functionalityi used the hdmi to usb interface to my large tv and downloaded movies from prime within two days of receiving the unit the hd movies are great and with gb of memory the spooling from my verizon fios router is perfect at the highest frame rategood piece of equipment im working on the voice commands next,positive
959,replaced my paper white kindle with this fire hdmany trade offs battery life of course is worse but now i can read comics in color watch movies and listen to my prime music plus not much bigger then a large phone,positive
960,i would give this kindle no stars if i could first of all i am not from nor do i live inamerica my husband recently came back from vacation in the us and being the loving man that he is brought me this a present because i love to read little did i know i was entering a world of heartache and distress from out of the box my head started to hurt it had trouble connecting to to our wifi then registering it in my name another problem uploading a gift card downloading usable applications such as netflix and youtube even downloading a book to read i was gettingconnection problems anderrors even through all this i expected the problems to sort out itself thinking this cannot be how a kindle should act the last straw came the next day when i attempted to read a book i literally sweat to download the kindle shutdown without warning still being hopeful left it to charge later that day i went to check on it and to my surprise it came on but kept restarting constantly taking me to the lock screen and shutting downi was at my wits end called amazons customer service after about and hour and a couple phone cards later no solution was provided troubleshooting after troubleshooting suggestions did not help the unresponsive kindle i enquired about an upgrade to different series so that i would not have these issues however this took another hour and and more phone cards which by the way in my country is very very expensive and with this sacrifice i still did not receive a proper answer i am exhausted and utterly disappointed in amazons kindle which was paid for and has been unresponsive since the second day of use after a frustrating two days of back and forth communication i am still awaiting a solution which is a replacement i have to pay for to clear because like i said in the beginning i am not from and do not live in america an added expense because amazon sold me unreliable electronicsso if you are looking for something good and reliable avoid this kindle entirely i assure you its not worth the headache,neutral
961,i am disappointed upon trying to order the hd a slew of color options appeared apparently these were for the hdso while i thought i got a great deal on the hd it was swapped out and i wasnt paying enough attention for the hd this is our th kindle and i am very disappointed add to that it was shipped in a bubble envelope since it is a gift i dont have enough time to return it for the hd shame on you amazon very shady,neutral
962,finally decided to take the plunge and purchase the fire hdplus the price was right between a smart phone and a kindle ereader didnt think i needed another electronic device oh why did i wait so long am very very pleased with the fire although still becoming accustomed to its many attributes the size is convenient to carry in my bag and the battery life is good love the way whatever i am reading syncs with my other devices and not being a fan of tv it enables me to enjoy videos and audio books also very easy to operate would highly recommend the fire to anyone,positive
963,if this was my first kindle fire i would rate ithowever i do own a kindle fire hdx so i am spoiled it is much slower than my hdx it was a gift for my grandson as he always takes mine he still takes mine and i use the firewhen reading and as a backup it runs great the hdx is just better all around my kindle and my keurigbring me much happiness,positive
964,right off the bat im disappointed not a shred of instruction came with this device im not a techie by any stretch but im also not an idiot come on guys how about some kind of instruction manual ie how long do you charge it before use initial set up anything so far all ive been able to do in thehr ive had it is put it on the charger turn it on and choose a language not the most patient person for the learn as you go mantra when it comes to this stuffand on the item decription page i cant even find the ask a question prompts to ask anybody,negative
965,i got this to use mainly for streaming video and surfing the web price point is amazing and display is great im more of an ios fan so i dont do much with this other than what i saidbut its absolutely perfect for what i need nice size and weight as wellbattery life could be better,positive
966,i was tired of giving mine away every five minutes to my daughter and son so i got a second one and i am not sorry i got a great deal and it came very fast i was happy with the new features like a camera and smaller design i find kindle to be better than ipadsjust a personal preference and i am not charged an arm and a leg for services,positive
967,i have had this kindle fire formonths ive tried to be patient with it but aside from the added value of access to the amazon original series on video i have been dissatisfied almost from day one main issue amazon music it is crap when id download songs they would download as unknown artist even though the artist is clearly associated in the music cloud storage id go to the amazon discusion threads for solutions they didnt work yet still i tried to be patientthe last straw happened today when amazon music conked out on me to save myself the bother of typing out the details ill say that i had the same problem that is referred to in this thread suggested fixes did not work and basically i am left with a tablet that is a good book reader can play a few good movies here and there but does not play music a tablet that does not play music is uselessso after this experience and an even worse experience with another androidbased tablet it is with great regret that i come to realize that an ipad is the only way to go time to bite the bullet and spend the money at least the music will play,negative
968,i love this gadget i use it for online piano lessons and cooking and craft classes it is so nice to use in the kitchen for recipes the hi res display is crystal clear for watching tv shows late night and it hooks up to my blue tooth speaker or headphones effortlessly,positive
969,still exploring itmy previous tablet was maybeyears old before it died so getting started has been kind of slow since there are no beginning instructions at all but i am getting itworks for tweets and emailsnot going to use a lot of the programs it came with and i guess since everything starts with amazon i need to learn this avenue out to the wider worldbut the price was very attractivecamera produces kind of funky photos but i have an iphone for thatall in all good item for the price,neutral
970,amazon has been getting better and better with these tablets a really wonderful alternative to the more expensive tablets on the market my daughter loves this thing and it is very easy to put locks with parental blocks and settings,positive
971,app store is wanting sometimes i have to shutdown tablet not just a turn off and then back on to connect to wifi weird surfing the web is sometimes aggravating i got this to replace my nexusdefinitely a step down,negative
972,the os is weak and leaves much to be desiredi regret not paying extra to avoid the incessant advertising the home screen carousel is annoying as it automatically adds your most recently used apps the onboard browser silk is ok but doesnt offer many homescreen options you can install chrome but not through the amazon storethe cameras are poor display is decent and sound was better than expected spend the extra cash for a nexus,negative
973,if you love your kindle dont go near this pain in the xxx the battery is constantly run down the cool thing about a kindle for true readers is that as soon as you finish one book you can download another book and it can be whatever you are in the mood for i used to packorbooks for aweek vacation because i dont know what ill be in the mood to read next with the kindle you can download any available book anywherewith the fire hd you must have paid internet access so is your in an expensive hotel that doesnt provide internet access for free forget it you better have done the preparationdownloaded some books while you were at homethis device is not for someone who loves to read this device is for someone who just wants one more device to surf the net with,neutral
974,we have had this tablet since christmas and it worked ok for a while but now it is unusablethe screen blanks itself out everyseconds or soit takesorseconds of pushing buttons and swiping the screen to get it backof course when it comes back it displays an advertisementi have tried updating the software and turning the power off and on to reset the machine but nothing is helpingi have given up,negative
975,pretty good little tabletespecially nice for kids because of the freetime feature i never have to worry my kids are doing something inappropriate because i set the controls for all their content and time limits the peace of mind is worth that alonei have had troubles with minor glitchy things that make it not a fullstars the screen is sometimes unresponsive or slow to register when touched and internet pages often have to be loaded twiceotherwise we are happy with it,neutral
976,bought this for my son for christmas greatwell worth the moneyvery useful tabletwe play games do internet research stream movies and showsvery happyonly disappointed that i cant use a memory card with it for more memory,positive
977,i love my hd as it has a great screen but yet is very small an convenient to bring with you to watch movies read book play some apps etcthe adfree is not necessary to purchase as the ads are not very frequent and may interest you from time to timethe amazon case is very handy to watch the videos from a horizontal or lateral formatthe case is magnetic so it snaps close very welloverall i would recommend this device especially when you can get it for under,positive
978,i put off getting a kindle for years because ive never really liked reading ebooks which ive done for years with kindle on my pcbut i always wondered if reading on a device i held in my hand might be different than reading on my laptop thus i started looking at kindles but didnt like they only had black and white screensso i started looking at kindle fires and when this one went on sale forone week decided it was time to get a kindlei reasoned that if i still didnt like reading ebooks on a kindle at least with the fire i would also have a computer and a device i could use for listening to musicwell it turns out i love reading ebooks on my kindle fire almost as much as reading hard copies of booksactually i havent read any kindle books yet but am reading books sent from netgalley which took me a while to figure out were under docs not books i played around with the fonts font sizes and brightness to get my reading screen exactly how i wanted itunlike books or docs though you only have the choice of three font sizes when viewing the internet on this kindle fire which is not a problem with me but im sure its a problem with some individuals since the web print is so smallupdateafter learning more about the device however i see you can enlarge the print on the web page as you readi havent really used the fire much for the interneti still prefer using my laptop for thati also havent tried the camera since i always prefer digital cameras when taking pictures than using cell phones or other such devicesive listened to some music however and think the sound is fine while navigating the touch screen is never a problem when reading books sometimes it is a problem for other thingsi dont know if its me since im not use to using touch screens or if its the fire maybe i should get a touch screen stylus penits never a big continuous problem thoughhence all in all i love my kindle fire and am very happy i got one to read books im also very happy i got the magenta onei had second thoughts about getting such a bright color but i really like having such a colorful kindleif you love colors get a fireupdatei got a stylus pen actuallyof them pack of pink blue purple red black stylus universal touch screen capacitive pen for kindle touch ipadiphone sand have no problem with the touch screen any longer also a great little speaker for this fire is the hp white roar mini speaker pnaaablit connects with bluetooth in seconds sounds much better than the fire speaker and comes in various colorsbut not magenta,positive
979,its a chunky little devil thick and heavyit works well enoughit will greet you with an ad every time it wakes up which is mildly annoyinginterface is adequate but like the amazon web site you will get a lot of links to other stuff you might likelove the backlight i can read with the lights offalso makes a nice flashlightwas able to adjust the text display a little to make reading easier for mei dont use the music appsprice is good and i bought it because i loved my paperwhite which broke,neutral
980,this is the best combination of features and bang for your buck no doubt about it the pixel rate is higher on this display and comes really close to what i am used to seeing on my fire hdx sooooooo glad that i followed the reviewers who pointed this out and ordered this size for my black fridaycyber monday splurge and i love the smaller more portable and convenient form factor worked perfectly out of the box with no issues or frustrating performance lapses the screen is so crisp with this pixel rate that the hdis a great readeraudio book performer too,neutral
981,i find this to small for comfortable readingi should have gotten a larger size as my cell phone is almost as big and actually does morethe ads on turning it on are also tiresomedefinitely worth the extra money to get the ad free version,positive
982,ive only had the tablet for about a month so i can review it in terms on longevityso far this tablet well exceeds my expectations for something with such a low price tag crystal clear hd resolution pretty decent sounding speakers and comfortable in handthe only reason i wouldnt give it a fullstars is because of the app market the apps available are very very limitedoverall though its a great tablet and worth the price especially if youre a reader,positive
983,day two so far very disappointed i will say i am not very tech savvy but can usually figure this stuff out seems like no matter where i go on this tablet i get an ad im trying to install wallpaper there isnt any i cant get you tube in full screen and without ads after everything i press i guess im going to have to call in for support hopefully i will be able to amend this review im probably just not used to it,neutral
984,the processor seems slow it does all of the things i would want a tablet to do but it takes much longer than it should to closeopen appsprogramsalso the highlighting of text from one page to another is not smooth or easyand i cant figure out how to edit the name of my bookmarkswhich seems crazy or at least more complicated than it should be,negative
985,i really enjoy using it but i find it working slow very often i have it for only a week and it is already freezing or just taking too long to go back to the home page and i also have to click more than once on links so they finally openfor example i am on facebook and i click on a link that someone shared and it always bring me to the browser page but the link is not there i have to go back to the app and click on the same link again and it works after the second time that really bothers but other than that i love it,neutral
986,this is the first time i have been disappointed by amazonthis product is not designed for the customer but for the corporationi bought the first amazon fire and loved it so i bought the firewithout reading any reviews it was an instant buy because i trusted amazon to continue their excellencedo not buy this item and heres whythe onoff and volume buttons are small and hard to press in the dark you will spendseconds or more trying to find the damn buttonsthe plugin to charge is hard to findthis may seem minor but if you like to read in bed with lights off and then you want to plug this thing in you have to get out of bed turn on a light and plug it in to be fair i used the firefor a couple of monthsbattery drains very fasti will leave for work and the battery will be atwhen i get home its atand the fire is warm to the touchyou must completely shut the device down to truly conserve batterymy expectations as a consumer when i put the fireto sleep it should conserve batterslow operating systemi upgraded to thebecause the first fire hd i owned was becoming laggy and slowthe fireis just as slowi saw no measurable difference in speedadsthanks to adblock plus and netflixprime i have not had to suffer invasive ads for three years except when i watch the superbowl every year i am essentially a consumer that seeks my own needs rather than being influenced by outsidersyou have to search deep in the settings to figure out how to turn off the ads and even then they never really go awayi would gladly pay extra to be ad freethe market is saturated with similar devices and behind each one is corporation that is wanting you to buy into their products onlyso they design products to suck you inonce you buy an apple product you are more likely to continue to buy apple for exampleamazon is an incredible company with a devotion to the customer that is unparalleled in my opinionbut buying this device has shown me that the customer is not amazons end game duh they are forprofit but you know what i meanskip this product because buying it reinforces amazon treating its customers like cattleno moo from me,neutral
987,i absolutely hate this product i have had nothing but problems with it since i got it i only read books on it and i am constantly having to shut it off and turn it back on because it freezes up i will definitely be going back to my kindle fire as soon as i can i definitely would not recommend this product,positive

990,pros good battery life averageshours of usage is no p but the image quality is great for being xinch tablet free daily apps and the performance is surprisingly good for being a lower endtabletcons the browser crashes if it gets overloaded with images no google apps no stereo sound crappy camera no multitasking some game apps are incompatible with kindle hd,positive
991,the fire arrived on time and was well packed unfortunately the charging cable i got seemed to be frayed as if it were used it took a day to charge fully and lost charge quickly borrowed a friends charger that worked much better now my charger doesnt work at all and its only been a couple weeks,neutral
