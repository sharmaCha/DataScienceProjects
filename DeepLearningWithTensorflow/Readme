This project is for Image classification using Google's Open source Deep Learning (one of the recent Artificial Intelligence
growing subset) Library Tensorflow.

The images are pre-processed (flattened to 1 D, matrix of vectors created) and using Convolution Neural Networks, images of celebs 
dataset are classified. The dataset is available in Google and easy to access.

The project is focused to understand and explore Deep Networks model building.
This project is under development.
