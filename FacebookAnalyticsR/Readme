Connecting to the Facebook API via App:

First we have to create an App on the Facebook platform. We will use this app to connect to the Facebook API. 
This way you can manage your connections very good but it also has some disadvantages. 
Different than in version 1 of the API you can now just get information of the friends who are also using the app. 
This creates big problems as you can´t create a friend network with all you friends anymore.

To create a new app go to https://developers.facebook.com

Click on “Apps” and choose “Add a New App“. In the next window choose “Website” and give your app a fancy name.

Apply the changes with “Create App ID“.

Then using the API ID and token, we do Data Mining of our Profile in R.
